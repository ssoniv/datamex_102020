# Project: TALES OF PYTHONIA

## Overview

The game is a single - match RPG battle.

There are three job classes:
    Archer
    Mage
    Sowrdsman
    
Each class has a unique set of stats:
    health
    power
    agility
and each has a special ability. That increases one stat in exchange of reducing another.


## The begining fase
   At the begining the player chooses which job class he wants to use:
   And he will know what special he is offered there.
   
   The opponent is selected at random and the player will be noted who he/she will be fighting against.
   
  
  
## The turns

   There is a turn based strategy set by the agility of each class. The turns are determined by this stat. The higher the agility the more turns available for that class.
   The player selects one of this actions:
       Attack: the player attacks with the classes strength 
       Special: the player gets a stat boost that last for a while(the player will be noted when the stats end)
       Defend: the player will receive on half damage the next attack
       
## The end
   The game finishes when one character, the player or the opponent, reaches 0 health.
