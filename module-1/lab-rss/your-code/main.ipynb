We do so out of genuine curiosity as well as professional necessity: Q is an ML/AI consultant, Chris is a product manager in the AI space, and Shane is an attorney.&nbsp; While we approach our questions from different angles because of our different roles,&nbsp; we all have the same goal in mind: we want to elicit truth and get people working with us to dig deeper into an issue. Preferably before things get out of hand, but sometimes precisely because they have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A recent discussion led us down the path of our favorite questions: what they are, why they&#8217;re useful, and when they don&#8217;t work so well.&nbsp; We then each chose our top three questions, which we&#8217;ve detailed in this article.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We hope you&#8217;re able to borrow questions you haven&#8217;t used before, and even cook up new questions that are more closely related to your personal and professional interests.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What makes a good question?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before we get too far, let&#8217;s explore what we mean by a &#8220;good question.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For one, it&#8217;s <em>broad and open-ended</em><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; It&#8217;s a lot less &#8220;did this happen?&#8221; and more &#8220;what happened?&#8221;&nbsp; It encourages people to share their thoughts and go deep.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s an implied &#8220;tell me more&#8221; in an open-ended question.&nbsp; Follow it with silence, and (as any professional interrogator will tell you) people will fill in extra details.&nbsp;They will get to <em>what</em> happened, along with <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> and <em>why.</em>&nbsp; They will tell a full story, which may then lead to more questions, which branch into other stories. All of this fills in more pieces to the puzzle.&nbsp; Sometimes, it sheds light on parts of the puzzle you didn&#8217;t know existed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By comparison, yes/no questions implicitly demand nothing more than what was expressly asked.&nbsp; That makes them too easy to dodge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two, a good question <em>challenges the person asking it</em> as much as (if not more than) the person who is expected to answer.&nbsp; Anyone can toss out questions at random, in an attempt to fill the silence. To pose <em>useful</em> questions requires that you first understand the present situation, know where you want to wind up, and map out stepping-stones between the two.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Case in point: the Daniel Pennac line that opened this piece was uttered by a detective who was &#8220;interviewing&#8221; a person in a coma.&nbsp; As he inspected their wounds, he asked more questions to&nbsp; explore their backstory, and that helped him to piece together his next steps of the investigation.&nbsp; Perhaps Inspector Pennac was inspired by Georg Cantor, who once said: &#8220;To ask the right question is harder than to answer it.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Three, a good question <em>doesn&#8217;t always have a right answer</em>.&nbsp; Some of them don&#8217;t have any answer at all.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s fine. Sometimes the goal of asking a question is to break the ice on a topic, opening a discussion that paints a larger picture.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Four, sometimes a question is effective precisely because<em> it comes from an unexpected place or person</em>.&nbsp;While writing this piece, one author pointed out (spoiler alert) that the attorney asked all of the technical questions, which seems odd, until you realize that he&#8217;s had to ask those because other people did not. When questions seem to come out of nowhere—but they are really born of experience—they can shake people out of the fog of status quo and open their eyes to new thoughts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>A brief disclaimer</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The opinions presented here are personal, do not reflect the view of our employers, and are not professional product, consulting, or legal advice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The questions</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What does this company <em>really</em> do?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> This is the kind of question you sometimes have to ask three times.&nbsp;The first time, someone will try to hand you the company&#8217;s mission statement or slogan.&nbsp;The second time, they&#8217;ll provide a description of the company: industry vertical, size, and revenue.&nbsp;So you ask again, this time with an emphasis on the <em>really</em>.&nbsp;And then you wait for the question to sink in, and for the person to work backwards from all of the company&#8217;s disparate activities to see what it&#8217;s all truly <em>for.</em>&nbsp;Which will be somewhere between the <em>raison d&#8217;etre </em>and the <em>sine qua non.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Taking the time to work this out is like building a mathematical model: if you understand what a company <em>truly</em> does, you don&#8217;t just get a better understanding of the present, but you can also predict the future.&nbsp;It guides decisions such as what projects to implement, what competitors to buy, and whom to hire into certain roles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a concrete example, take Amazon.&nbsp;Everyone thinks it&#8217;s a store. It <em>has</em> a store, but at its core, Amazon is a delivery/logistics powerhouse.&nbsp; Everything they do has to end with your purchases winding up in your hot little hands. Nothing else they do matters—not the slick website, not the voice-activated ordering, not the recommendation engine—unless they get delivery and logistics down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I explore this early in a consulting relationship.&nbsp;Sometimes even early in the sales cycle. And I don&#8217;t try to hide it; I&#8217;ll ask it, flat-out, and wait for people to fill the silence.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> My work focuses on helping companies to start, restart, and assess their ML/AI efforts. Understanding the company&#8217;s true purpose unlocks the business model and sheds light on what is useful to do with the data. As a bonus, it can also highlight cases of conflict.&nbsp;Because sometimes key figures have very different ideas of what the company is and what it should do next.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> This question can catch people off-guard.&nbsp; Since I work in the AI space, people sometimes have a preconceived notion that I&#8217;ll only talk about data and models.&nbsp; Hearing this question from an ostensibly technical person can be jarring… though, sometimes, that can actually help the conversation along.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s definitely a double-edged sword.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What is a bad idea?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> Ideation is about coming up with the &#8220;best&#8221; ideas. What is the best way to solve this problem? What is the most important? What is best for the business?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem with &#8220;best&#8221; is that it is tied up with all of the biases and assumptions someone already has. To get to what really matters we have to understand the edge of what is good or bad. The gray area between those tells you the shape of the problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Half the time this question will give you real, bad ideas.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What has been surprising to me is that the other half of the time, the so-called &#8220;bad&#8221; idea is really a &#8220;good&#8221; idea in disguise.&nbsp; You just have to relax certain assumptions. Often these assumptions were just set at some point without a reason or much to back it up.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I like to ask this after going through a lot of the &#8220;best&#8221; questions in an ideation session. It can be adapted to focus on different types of &#8220;bad,&#8221; like &#8220;stupid,&#8221; &#8220;wasteful,&#8221; and &#8220;unethical.&#8221;&nbsp; Ask follow up questions about why they believe the idea is &#8220;bad&#8221; and why it might actually be &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> How can you truly know what is good without also knowing what is bad?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> When I was a design consultant working for clients in highly regulated industries (.e.g banking, insurance, etc.), I found this can be a difficult question to ask. In those cases you will need to get your legal team to either grant the attorney/client privilege to ask the questions, or ask the prompt/response in such a way that it protects people in the conversation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>How did you obtain your training data?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> In the early days of ML training data, companies and research teams frequently used “some stuff we found on the Internet” as a source for training data. This approach has two problems: (1) there may not be an appropriate license attached to the data, and (2) the data may not be a good representative sample for the intended use. It’s worth noting that the first issue is not just limited to images collected from the Internet. In recent years a number of research datasets (including Stanford’s Brainwash, Microsoft’s MS Celeb, and Duke’s MTMC) were withdrawn for reasons including a lack of clarity around the permission and rights granted by people appearing in the datasets. More recently, at least one company has earned itself significant PR and legal controversy for collecting training data sources from social media platforms under circumstances that were at least arguably a violation of both the platform’s terms of service and platform users&#8217; legal rights.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The safest course of action is also the slowest and most expensive: obtain your training data as part of a collection strategy that includes efforts to obtain the correct representative sample under an explicit license for use <em>as training data</em>. The next best approach is to use existing data collected under broad licensing rights that include use as training data even if that use was not the explicit purpose of the collection.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I like to ask this as early as possible.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t want to invest your time, effort, and money building models only to later realize that you can’t use them, or that using them will be much more expensive than anticipated because of unexpected licenses or royalty payments. It’s also a good indirect measure of training data quality: a team that does not know where their data originated is likely to not know other important details about the data as well.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> No matter how the data is collected, a review by legal counsel before starting a project—and allow me to emphasise the word <em>before</em>—can prevent significant downstream headaches.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong>&nbsp; This question is most useful when asked before the model goes into production. It loses value once the model is on sale or in service, particularly if it is embedded in a hardware device that can’t be easily updated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What is the intended use of the model? How many people will use it? And what happens when it fails?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> One of the most interesting aspects of machine learning (ML) is its very broad applicability across a variety of industries and use cases. ML can be used to identify cats in photos as well as to guide autonomous vehicles. Understandably, the potential harm caused by showing a customer a dog when they expected to see a cat is significantly different from the potential harm caused by an autonomous driving model failing to properly recognize a stop sign.&nbsp; Determining the risk profile of a given model requires a case-by-case evaluation but it can be useful to think of the failure risk in three broad categories:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might die or have their sensitive data exposed”</em> — Examples of these kinds of uses include automated driving/flying systems and biometric access features. ML models directly involved in critical safety systems are generally easy to identify as areas of concern. That said, the risks involved require a very careful evaluation of the processes used to generate, test, and deploy those models, particularly in cases where there are significant public risks involved in any of the aforementioned steps.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might lose access to an important service”</em> — Say, payment fraud detection and social media content detection algorithms.&nbsp;Most of us have had the experience of temporarily losing access to a credit card for buying something that “didn’t fit our spending profile.” Recently, a law professor who <em>studies</em> automated content moderation was suspended … by a social media platform&#8217;s automated content moderation system. All this because they quoted a reporter who <em>writes</em> about automated content moderation. These kinds of service-access ML models are increasingly used to make decisions about what we can spend, what we can say, and even where and how we can travel. The end-user risks are not as critical as in a safety or data protection system, but their failure can represent a significant reputation risk to the business that uses them when the failure mode is to effectively ban users from a product or service. It is important for companies employing ML in these situations to understand how this all fits into the overall risk profile of the company. They&#8217;d do well to carefully weigh the relative merit of using ML to <em>augment</em> existing controls and human decision-making versus <em>replace</em> those controls and leave the model as the sole decision-maker.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, people may be mildly inconvenienced or embarrassed”</em> —&nbsp; Such systems include image classifiers, recommendation engines, and automated image manipulation tools. In my experience, companies significantly understate the potential downside for ML failures that, while only inconvenient to individual users, can carry significant PR risk in the aggregate. A company may think that failures in a shopping recommendation algorithm are “not a big deal” until the algorithm suggests highly inappropriate results to millions of users for an innocuous and very common query.&nbsp; Similarly, employees working on a face autodetection routine for a camera may think occasional failures are insignificant until the product is on sale and users discover that the feature fails to recognize faces with facial hair, or a particular hairstyle, or a particular range of skin color.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I use this question to determine both the potential risk from an individual failure and the potential aggregate risk from a systemic failure.&nbsp; It also feeds back into my question about training data: some relatively minor potential harms are worth additional investment in training data and testing if they could inconvenience millions, or billions, of users or create a significant negative PR cycle for a company.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> This is the sort of question that gets people thinking about the importance of their model in the overall business. It can also be a helpful guide that companies invest in such a model, and the kinds of business processes that are amenable to models.&nbsp; Remember that models that work nearly perfectly can still fail spectacularly in unusual situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> We don’t always have the luxury of time or accurate foresight.&nbsp;Sometimes a business does not know how a model will be used: a model is developed for Product X and repurposed for Product Y, a minor beta feature suddenly becomes an overnight success, or a business necessity unexpectedly forces a model into widespread production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What&#8217;s the cost of doing nothing?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> A consultant is an agent of change.&nbsp;When a prospect contacts me to discuss a project, I find it helpful to compare the cost of the desired change to the cost of another-change or even to the cost of the not-change. &#8220;What happens if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> do this?&nbsp;What costs do you incur, what exposures do take on now? And six months from now?&#8221;&nbsp;A high cost of doing nothing means that this is an urgent matter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some consultants will tell you that a high cost of doing nothing is universally great (it means the prospect is ready to move) and a low cost is universally bad (the prospect isn&#8217;t really interested).&nbsp; I see it differently: we can use that cost of doing nothing as a guide to how we define the project&#8217;s timeline, fee structure, and approach. If the change is extremely urgent—a very high cost of doing nothing—it may warrant a quick fix now, soon followed by a more formal approach once the system is stable. A low cost of doing nothing, by comparison, means that we can define the project as &#8220;research&#8221; or &#8220;an experiment,&#8221; and move at a slower pace.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it:</strong> I will ask this one, flat-out, once a consulting prospect has outlined what they want to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> Besides helping to shape the structure of the project, understanding the cost of doing nothing can also shed light on the prospect&#8217;s motivations. That, in turn, can unlock additional information that can be relevant to the project.&nbsp;(For example, maybe the services I provide will help them reach the desired change, but that change won&#8217;t really help the company.&nbsp;Perhaps I can refer them to someone else in that case.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> Sometimes people don&#8217;t have a good handle on the risks and challenges they (don&#8217;t) face.&nbsp;They may hastily answer that this is an urgent matter when it&#8217;s not; or they may try to convince you that everything is fine when you can clearly see that the proverbial house is on fire. When you detect that their words and the situation don&#8217;t align, you can ask them to shed light on their longer-term plans.&nbsp;That may help them to see the situation more clearly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>How would we know we are wrong?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> This is something that was inspired from the intersection of an incredibly boring decision-science book and roadmap planning. Decision trees and roadmaps are very useful when building out the possible spaces of the future. However, for both decision trees and roadmaps we are usually overly optimistic in how we will proceed.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>We fail at properly considering failure.</em>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To appropriately plan for the future we must consider the different ways we can be wrong. Sometimes it will be at a certain decision point (“we didn’t get enough signups to move forward”) or an event trigger (“we see too many complaints”).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we consider this wrong-ness and the possible next step, we can start to normalize this failure and make better decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it:&nbsp; </strong>It&#8217;s best to ask this when you find that certainty is at a high point for the project. More often than not, people don’t consider ways to detect that they need to change course.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> You build a map into the future based on what you can detect. This helps make hard decisions easier because you are effectively practicing the decision process before you are in the heat of the moment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> When things are currently going &#8220;wrong&#8221; it can be a sensitive subject for people. I’ve found it is easier to talk about how to get out of a current wrong situation than considering additional future situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What upstream obligations do you have, and what downstream rights do you want to retain?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> Imagine you employ a vendor to provide or enrich your training data, or you pay for consulting services related to ML.&nbsp;What happens to the information used by the vendors to build your product?&nbsp; Their downstream rights there run the gamut from “absolutely nothing” to “retaining a full copy of the training data, labels, trained models, and test results.” The median position, in my observation, tends to be that the vendor retains control of any new techniques and information derived from the work that would be useful <em>in general,</em> such as new methods of programmatically applying error correction to a trained model, but not the specific data used to train the model or the resulting trained model.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From the customer perspective, downstream rights are tied to competition/cost tradeoffs and the rights associated with training data.&nbsp; A company that considers ML a competitive advantage likely will not want their models or derivative data available to competitors, and they must balance this against the business consideration that vendors which retain downstream rights typically charge lower fees (because reselling that data or models can be a source of revenue). In addition, training data usually comes with contractual limitations and customers of ML services need to ensure they are not granting downstream rights that they don’t have in their upstream agreements. Finally, some kinds of training data, such as medical records or classified government data, may forbid unauthorized access or use in systems that lack adequate safeguards and audit logs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>This question is less relevant to companies that have an entirely in-house workflow (they generate their own training data, train their own models, and use models with their own employees and tools).&nbsp; It is highly relevant to companies that buy or sell ML services, use external vendors for part of their workflow, or handle sensitive data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong>&nbsp; The notion of downstream rights is not a new question, nor is it specific to the ML world.&nbsp; Almost all vendor relationships involve delineating the intellectual property (IP) and tools that each party brings to the project, as well as the ownership of new IP developed during the project. Helping founders to recognize and establish those boundaries early on can save them a lot of trouble later.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> This is a question a company definitely wants to answer before they&#8217;ve provided data or services to a counterparty.&nbsp; These issues can be very difficult to resolve once data has been shared or work has begun.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What if …? Then …?&nbsp; and What next?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> A risk is a potential change that comes with consequences.&nbsp; To properly manage risk—to avoid those consequences—you need to identify those changes in advance (perform a risk assessment) and sort out what to do about them (devise your risk mitigation plans). That&#8217;s where this trio of questions comes in: <em>&#8220;What if?&#8221;</em> is the key to a risk assessment, as it opens the discussion on ways a project may deviate from its intended path.&nbsp; <em>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</em> explores the consequences of that deviation.&nbsp;The <em>&#8220;What next?&#8221;</em> starts the discussion on how to handle them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;<em>What if</em> … our data vendor goes out of business? <em>Then?</em>&nbsp;Our business is hamstrung.&nbsp;<em>What next?</em>&nbsp;We&#8217;d better have a backup data vendor in the wings.&nbsp; Or better yet, keep two vendors running concurrently so that we can switch over with minimal downtime.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;<em>What if</em> … something changes, and the model&#8217;s predictions are wrong most of the time?&nbsp;<em>Then? </em>We&#8217;re in serious trouble, because that model is used to automate purchases.&nbsp;<em>What next?</em> We should implement monitors around the model, so that we can note when it&#8217;s acting out of turn. We should also add a &#8216;big red button&#8217; so that a person can quickly, easily, and completely shut it down if it starts to go haywire.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>&nbsp;Once we&#8217;ve sorted out what the client wants to achieve, I&#8217;ll round out the picture by walking them through some <em>&#8220;What if? Then? What next?&#8221;</em> scenarios where things don&#8217;t work out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> It&#8217;s too easy to pretend the not-intended outcomes don&#8217;t exist if you don&#8217;t bring them up. I want my clients to understand what they&#8217;re getting into, so they can make informed decisions on whether and how to proceed. Going through even a small-scale risk assessment like this can shed light on the possible downside loss that&#8217;s lurking alongside their desired path. All of that risk can weigh heavily on their investment, and possibly even wipe out any intended benefit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> The business world, especially Western business culture, has a strange relationship with positive attitudes. This energy can be infectious and it can help to motivate a team across the finish line. It can also convince people to pretend that the non-intended outcomes are too remote or otherwise not worth consideration.&nbsp;That&#8217;s usually when they find out, the hard way, what can really go wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How to handle this varies based on your role in the company, internal company politics, your ability to bring about change, and your ability to weather a storm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>A random question</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> The most important question is one that isn’t expected. It is one that leads to unexpected answers. We don’t have dialog for dialog sake; we do it to learn something new. Sometimes the thing we learn is that we aren’t aligned.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’ve found that the most unexpected thing is something that we wouldn’t choose based on our current thought process. Randomly choosing a question from a collection appropriate for your domain is really valuable. If you are building something for the web, what kinds of questions could you ask about a web project? This is helpful when the checklists of things to do get too large to try all of them. Pick a few at random.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You can take it a step further and pick questions from outside of your domain. This can simply be a list of provocations that require a high amount of interpretation by you to make sense. This is because randomness doesn’t work without the lens of human intuition.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Randomness without this intuition is just garbage. We do the work to bridge from random questions to some new idea related to our problem. We build the analogies in our mind even when something is seemingly not connected at first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>When you find that you keep asking the same questions. I have decks of cards like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies\">Oblique Strategies</a> for provocations, <a href=\"https://www.trytriggers.com/\">Triggers</a> for domain-specific questions, and others that can provide randomness. Domain-specific random questions can also be very impactful. Eventually, I expect models like GPT-n to provide appropriate random questions to prompts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> Even with all of the questions we ask to get out of bias, we are still biased. We still have assumptions we don’t realize. Randomness doesn’t care about your biases and assumptions. It will ask a question that you think on the surface is stupid, but when you think about it is important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> With teams that are high on certainty they may think of the random question as a toy or distraction. The people I’ve found to be incredibly confident in their world trivialize the need to question bias. They will even try to actively subvert the process sometimes. If you hide the fact that a question was randomly chosen, it can go over better.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>In search of the bigger picture &#8230;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you&#8217;re collecting facts—names, numbers, times—then narrow questions will suffice.&nbsp; But if you&#8217;re looking to understand the bigger picture, if you want to get a meeting out of a rut, if you want people to <em>reflect</em> before they speak, then open-ended questions will serve you well.&nbsp; Doubly so when they come from an unexpected source and at an unexpected time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The questions we&#8217;ve documented here have helped us in our roles as an AI consultant, a product manager, and an attorney.&nbsp;(We also found it interesting that we use a lot of the same questions, which tells us how widely applicable they are.) We hope you&#8217;re able to put our favorite questions to use in your work. Perhaps they will even inspire you to devise and test a few of your own.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One point we hope we&#8217;ve driven home is that your goal in asking good questions isn&#8217;t to make yourself look smarter.&nbsp;Nor is it to get the answers you want to hear.&nbsp;Instead, your goal is to explore a problem space, shed light on new options, and mitigate risk. With that new, deeper understanding, you&#8217;re more prepared to work on the wicked problems that face us in the workplace and in the world at large.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/BiQVryBFH3A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

In traditional software engineering, precedent has been established for the transition of responsibility from development teams to maintenance, user operations, and site reliability teams. New features in an existing product often follow a similar progression. For traditional software, the domain knowledge and skills required to develop new features differ from those necessary to ensure that the product works as intended. Because product development and product operations are distinct, it’s logical for different teams and processes to be responsible for them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In contrast, many production AI systems rely on feedback loops that require the same technical skills used during initial development. Similarly, in “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product</a>,” Emmanuel Ameisen states: “Indeed, exposing a model to users in production comes with a set of challenges that mirrors the ones that come with debugging a model.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a result, at the stage when product managers for other types of products might shift to developing new features (or to other projects altogether), an AI product manager and the rest of the original development team should remain heavily involved. One reason for this is to tackle the (likely) lengthy backlog of ML/AI model improvements that will be discovered after the product engages with the real world. Another, of course, is to ensure that the product functions as expected and desired over time. We describe the final responsibility of the AI PM as <em>coordinating with the engineering, infrastructure, and site reliability teams to ensure all shipped features can be supported at scale.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article offers our perspective into the practical details of the AI PM’s responsibilities in the latter parts of the AI product cycle, as well as some insight into best practices in execution of those responsibilities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Debugging AI Products</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/bringing-an-ai-product-to-market/\">Bringing an AI Product to Market</a>, we distinguished the debugging phase of product development from pre-deployment evaluation and testing. This distinction assumes a slightly different definition of debugging than is often used in software development. We define debugging as the process of using logging and monitoring tools to detect and resolve the inevitable problems that show up in a production environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Emmanuel Ameisen again offers a useful framework for defining errors in AI/ML applications: “&#8230;three areas in particular are most important to verify: inputs to a pipeline, the confidence of a model and the outputs it produces.” To support verification in these areas, a product manager must first ensure that the AI system is capable of reporting back to the product team about its performance and usefulness over time.&nbsp; This may manifest in several ways, including the collection of explicit user feedback or comments via channels outside of the product team, and the provision of mechanisms to dispute the output of the AI system where applicable. Proper AI product monitoring is essential to this outcome.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>I/O validation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a technical perspective, it is entirely possible for ML systems to function on wildly different data. For example, you can ask an ML model to make an inference on data taken from a distribution very different from what it was trained on—but that, of course, results in unpredictable and often undesired performance. Therefore, deployed AI products should include validation steps to ensure that model inputs and outputs are within generally expected limits, before a model training or inference task is accepted as successful.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ideally, AI PMs would steer development teams to incorporate I/O validation into the initial build of the production system, along with the instrumentation needed to monitor model accuracy and other technical performance metrics. But in practice, it is common for model I/O validation steps to be added later, when scaling an AI product. Therefore, the PM should consider the team that will reconvene whenever it is necessary to build out or modify product features that:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>ensure that inputs are present and complete,</li><li>establish that inputs are from a realistic (expected) distribution of the data,</li><li>and trigger alarms, model retraining, or shutdowns (when necessary).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The composition of these teams will vary between companies and products, but a typical cross-functional team would likely include representatives from Data Science (for product-level experimentation and inference task validation), Applied Science (for model performance and evaluation), ML Engineering (for data and feature engineering, as well as model pipeline support) and Software/Feature Engineering (for integration with the full stack of the AI product—such as UI/UX, cloud services, and dev ops tools). Working together, this post-production development team should embrace continuous delivery principles, and prioritize the integration of any additional necessary instrumentation that was not already implemented during the model development process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, the AI PM must work with production engineering teams to design and implement the alerting and remediation framework. Considerations include where to set thresholds for each persona, alert frequency, and the degree of remediation automation (both what’s possible and desired).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Inference Task Speed and SLOs</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>During testing and evaluation, application performance is important, but not critical to success. In the production environment, when the outputs of an ML model are often a central (yet hidden) component of a greater application, speed and reliability are critically important. It is entirely possible for an AI product’s output to be absolutely correct from the perspective of accuracy and data quality, but too slow to be even remotely useful. Consider the case of autonomous vehicles: if the outputs from even one of the many critical ML models that comprise the vehicle’s AI-powered “vision” are delivered <em>after</em> a crash, who cares if they were correct?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In engineering for production, AI PMs must take into account the speed at which information from ML/AI models must be delivered (to validation tasks, to other systems in the product, and to users). Technologies and techniques—such as engineering specifically for GPU/TPU performance and caching—are important tools in the deployment process, but they are also additional components that can fail, and thus be responsible for the failure of an AI product’s core functionality. An AI PM’s responsibility is to ensure that the development team implements proper checks prior to release, and—in the case of failure—to support the incident response teams, until they are proficient in resolving issues independently.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI product managers must also consider availability: the degree to which the service that an AI product provides is <em>available</em> to other systems and users. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) provide a useful framework for encapsulating this kind of decision. In an <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">incident management blog post</a>, Atlassian defines SLOs as: “the individual promises you’re making to that customer… SLOs are what set customer expectations and tell IT and DevOps teams what goals they need to hit and measure themselves against. SLOs can be useful for both paid and unpaid accounts, as well as internal and external customers.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Service Level Indicators, Objectives, and Agreements (SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs) are well-known, frequently used, and well-documented tools for defining the availability of digital services.&nbsp; For cloud infrastructure some of the most common SLO types are concerned with availability, reliability and scalability. For AI products, these same concepts must be expanded to cover not just infrastructure, but also data and the system’s overall performance at a given task. While useful, these constructs are not beyond criticism. Chief among the challenges are: choosing the correct metrics to begin with, measuring and reporting once metrics are selected, and the lack of incentive for a service provider to update the service’s capabilities (which leads to outdated expectations). Despite these concerns, service level frameworks can be quite useful, and should be in the AI PM’s toolkit when designing the kind of experience that an AI product should provide.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Durability</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You must also take durability into account when building a post-production product plan. Even if well-designed, multi-layer fault detection and model retraining systems are carefully planned and implemented, every AI-powered system must be robust to the ever-changing and naturally stochastic environment that we (humans) all live in. Product managers should assume that any probabilistic component of an AI product will break at some point. A <em>good</em> AI product will be able to self-detect and alert experts upon such a failure; a <em>great </em>AI product will be able to detect the most common problems and adjust itself automatically—without significant interruption of services for users, or high-touch intervention by human experts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many ways to improve AI product durability, including:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/when-are-you-planning-to-retrain-your-machine-learning-model-5349eb0c4706\">Time-based model retraining</a>: retraining all core models periodically, regardless of performance.</li><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/why-machine-learning-models-degrade-in-production-d0f2108e9214\">Continuous retraining</a>: a data-driven approach that employs constant monitoring of the model’s key performance indicators and data quality thresholds.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s worth noting that model durability and retraining can raise legal and policy issues. For example, in many regulated industries, changing any core functionality of an AI system’s decision-making capability (i.e., objective functions, major changes to hyperparameters, etc.) require not only disclosure, but also monitored testing.&nbsp; As such, an AI Product Manager’s responsibility here extends to releasing not only a usable product, but one that can be ethically and legally consumed. It’s also important to remember that no matter what the approach to developing and maintaining a highly durable AI system, the product team must have access to high quality, relevant metrics on both model performance and functionality.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Monitoring</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Proper monitoring (and the software instrumentation necessary to perform it) is essential to the success of an AI product. However, monitoring is a loaded term. The reasons for monitoring AI systems are often conflated, as are the different types of monitoring and alerting provided by off-the-shelf tools. Emmanuel Ameisen once again provides a useful and concise definition of model monitoring as a way to “track the health of a system. For models, this means monitoring their performance and the equity of their predictions.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The simplest case of model monitoring is to compute key performance metrics (related to both model fit and inference accuracy) regularly. These metrics can be combined with human-determined thresholds and automated alerting systems to inform when a model has “drifted” beyond normal operating parameters. While ML monitoring is a relatively new product area, standalone commercial products (including <a href=\"https://www.fiddler.ai/\">Fiddler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.superwise.ai/\">superwise.ai</a>) are available, and monitoring tools are incorporated into all the major machine learning platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Separate from monitoring for model freshness, Ameisen also mentions the need to apply technical domain experience in designing monitoring systems that detect fraud, abuse, and attack from external actors. AI PMs should consult with Trust &amp; Safety and Security teams to combine the best principles and technical solutions with existing AI product functionality. In some specific domains—such as financial services or medicine—no easy technical solutions exist. In this case, it is the responsibility of the AI product team to build tools to detect and mitigate fraud and abuse in the system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we’ve mentioned previously, it’s not enough to simply monitor an AI system&#8217;s performance characteristics. It is even more important to consistently ensure that the AI product’s user-facing and business purposes are being fulfilled. This responsibility is shared by the development team with Design, UX Research, SRE, Legal, PR, and Customer Support teams. The AI PM’s responsibility is again to orchestrate reasonable and easily repeatable mitigations to any problems. It is crucial to design and implement specific alerting capabilities for these functions and teams. If you simply wait for complaints, they will arise far too late in the cycle for your team to react properly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No matter how well you research, design, and test an AI system, once it is released, people are going to complain about it. Some of those complaints will likely have merit, and responsible stewardship of AI products requires that users are given the ability to disagree with the system’s outputs and escalate issues to the product team.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is also entirely possible for this feedback to show you that the system is underserving a particular segment of the population, and that you may need a portfolio of models to serve more of the user base. As an AI PM, you have the responsibility to build a safe product for <em>everyone</em> in the population who might use it. This includes consideration of the complexities that come into play with intersectionality. For example, an AI product might produce great outcomes for wealthy, American, cisgender, heterosexual, White women—and although it might be tempting to assume those outcomes would apply to all women, such an assumption would be incorrect. Returning to previous anti-bias and AI transparency tools such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993\">Model Cards for Model Reporting</a> (Timnit Gebru, et al.) is a great option at this point. It is important not to pass this development task off to researchers or engineers alone; it is an integral part of the AI product cycle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If done right, users will never be aware of all the product monitoring and alerting that is in place, but don’t let that trick you. It’s essential to success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Post-Deployment Frameworks</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One question that an AI PM might ask when pondering these post-production requirements is: “This seems hard; can’t I just buy these capabilities from someone else?” This is a fair question, but—as with all things related to machine learning and artificial intelligence—the answer is far from a binary yes or no.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many tools available to help with this process, from traditional vendors and bleeding edge startups alike. Deciding what investment to make in MLOps tooling is an inherently complex task. However, careful consideration and proactive actions often lead to defendable competitive advantages over time. Uber (the developer of <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/scaling-michelangelo/\">Michelangelo</a>), Airbnb (developer of <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2018/public/schedule/detail/68114.html\">zipline</a>), and Google have all taken advantage of superior tooling and operations skills to build market-leading AI products.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nearly every ML/AI library touts full end-to-end capabilities, from enterprise-ready stacks (such as <a href=\"https://www.h2o.ai/\">H20.ai</a>, <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLFlow</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/\">Kubeflow</a>) to the highly specialized and engineer-friendly (such as <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/\">Seldon.io</a>) and everything in-between (like <a href=\"https://dask.org/\">Dask</a>). Enterprise level-frameworks often provide deep and well-supported integration with many common production systems; smaller companies might find this integration unnecessary or overly cumbersome. Regardless, it’s a safe bet that getting these off-the-shelf tools to work with your AI product in the exact ways you need them to will be costly (if not financially, then at least in time and human labor). That said—from a scale, security and features perspective—such capabilities may be required in many mature AI product environments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, building and scaling a software tool stack from scratch requires a significant sustained investment in both developer time and technology. Facebook, Uber, AirBnB, Google, Netflix, and other behemoths have all spent millions of dollars to build their ML development platforms; they also employ dozens to hundreds of employees, each tasked with building and scaling their internal capabilities. The upside here is that such end-to-end development to deployment frameworks and tools eventually become a competitive advantage, in and of themselves. However, it’s worth noting that in such environments, employing a single AI PM is not feasible. Instead, a cadre of PMs focused on different components of the AI product value chain are needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Building great AI products is a significant, cross-disciplinary, and time-consuming undertaking, even for the most mature and well-resourced companies. However, what ML and AI can accomplish at scale can be well worth the investment.&nbsp; Although a return on investment is never guaranteed, our goal is to provide AI PMs with the tools and techniques needed to build highly engaging and impactful AI products in a wide variety of contexts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this article, we focused on the importance of collaboration between product and engineering teams, to ensure that your product not only functions as intended, but is also robust to both the degradation of its effectiveness and the uncertainties of its operating environment. In the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a product release is just the beginning. Product managers have a unique place in the development ecosystem of ML/AI products, because they cannot simply guide the product to release and then turn it over to IT, SRE, or other post-production teams. AI product managers have a responsibility to oversee not only the design and build of the system’s capabilities, but also to coordinate the team during incidents, until the development team has completed enough knowledge transfer for independent post-production operation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The evolution of AI-enabled product experiences is accelerating at breakneck speed. In parallel, the emerging role of AI product management continues to evolve at a similar pace, to ensure that the tools and products delivered to the market provide true utility and value to both customers and businesses. Our goal in this four-part series on AI product management is to increase community awareness and empower individuals and teams to improve their skill sets in order to effectively steer AI product development toward successful outcomes. The best ML/AI products that exist today were brought to market by teams of PhD ML/AI scientists and developers who worked in tandem with resourceful and skilled product teams.&nbsp; All were essential to their success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the field of AI continues to mature, so will the exciting field of AI product management. We can’t wait to see what you build!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Sources:</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning\">MLOps: Continuous delivery and automation pipelines in machine learning</a> (Google)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2020/08/01/mlops-what-you-need-to-know/#43321e9b1214\">MLOps: What you need to know</a> (Forbes)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">SLA vs. SLO vs. SLI: What’s the difference?</a> (Atlassian) </li><li><a href=\"https://toddmorrill.github.io/blog/2019/10/05/MLOps-tooling\">MLOps Tooling</a> (Todd Morrill)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications</a> (O’Reilly)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/\">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> (O’Reilly)</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We would like to thank the many people who have&nbsp; contributed their expertise to the early drafts of the articles in this series, including: Emmanuel Ameisen, Chris Albon, Chris Butler, Ashton Chevalier, Hilary Mason, Monica Rogati, Danielle Thorp, and Matthew Wise.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/PtjwTz5sgwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

       "               '<p>The release of GPT-3 has reinvigorated a discussion of creativity and artificial intelligence. That&#8217;s a good discussion to have, primarily because it forces us to think carefully about what we mean when we use words like &#8220;creativity&#8221; and &#8220;art.&#8221; As I&#8217;ve argued in the past, each time we have this discussion, we end up raising the bar. Each time an AI system does something that looks “intelligent” or creative, we end up deciding that’s not what intelligence really is.  And that’s a good thing. AI is likely to teach us more about what intelligence and creativity are not than about what they are.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not terribly interested in whether AI can imitate human creativity. &#8220;Can an AI create a &#8216;new&#8217; poem that reads as if it were written by Keats, or a new piano sonata that sounds like Beethoven&#8221; isn&#8217;t a question that&#8217;s worth asking. Of course it can—if not now, it will be able to in the near future. We really don&#8217;t need a new Beethoven sonata; the 32 he wrote are enough. Nor do we need a new Keats ode, limited though his output was. Or a new Rembrandt. Imitation is ultimately a party trick: clever and amusing, but not really important. Sure, if you want texts for greeting cards or elevator music (or maybe even commercial pop), algorithms may do the trick.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What&#8217;s really important is the transition between different forms of creativity. How do you get something that&#8217;s qualitatively new, and not just imitation? Creativity isn&#8217;t about the artifacts as much as it&#8217;s about the transitions. How do you get from Bach to Haydn? How do you get from Haydn to Beethoven? And, even within the career of a single artist: how do you get from the beginning to the end? How do you get from Beethoven&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5dL-65mKe0\">first piano sonata</a>, which sounds like Haydn, to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg9cE-ceso\">last</a>, which at some points anticipates jazz? Artists aren&#8217;t stagnant. But I have no idea how even to ask whether an AI system can “mature” or “grow” in its output.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Great artists (and yes, I&#8217;m presuming a lot with the word &#8220;great&#8221;) frequently work by defining themselves against what came before. This is particularly clear with artists of the Romantic period in Germany, England, and France. The term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism\">Romanticism</a> didn&#8217;t come around until some years later, but they left behind several manifestos describing what they were trying to do, and how it was different from what came before. That is still how artists work: Nnedi Okorafor&#8217;s <a href=\"http://nnedi.blogspot.com/2019/10/africanfuturism-defined.html\">Africanfuturism</a> is important as a way of defining and directing her own work. The importance of these defining statements isn&#8217;t so much about “rightness” (in the sense of &#8220;this is what art is or should be&#8221;) but in setting a direction for their project. Can a machine do that? Can it decide how its work will be different from what came before? It&#8217;s not clear to me that it can&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s a significant step beyond any machine learning projects we currently have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although artists work by projecting their work into the future, by defining something &#8220;new,&#8221; their work is also derived from what came before—possibly as misinterpretation, but almost always as revision. Listen to the Beatles, and you hear something that was really built on the backbone of blues, filtered through some British pop-cultural trends. At the end of the &#8220;His Dark Materials&#8221; trilogy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pullman\">Phillip Pullman</a> thanks all the authors he stole from. Or, as T. S. Eliot <a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/200/sw11.html\">said</a>, “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.” Artists break from the past by reinterpreting that past.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For AI-generated art&#8211;where does that sense of &#8220;different&#8221; come from? Can artificial intelligence learn to steal and reinterpret? Where does that engagement with history, current events and even selfhood come from?  Without that, there’s no basis for reinterpretation aside from random perturbation. It&#8217;s not clear that a sense of history couldn&#8217;t come from a big model trained on a gigantic corpus (although the best we can do now is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/\">build models that have no idea what they are saying</a>). What kind of model would take that corpus and make something that was different, something that hadn&#8217;t been seen before? Would we care if Hamlet wasn&#8217;t written by Shakespeare in a specific historical context, but in 2025 by a computer trained on an archive of Elizabethan politics, drama, and history? (Never mind that an archive of Elizabethan drama would be very skimpy; most plays from that period were never published.) Would anyone care about the opera <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_in_China\">Nixon in China</a> if it didn&#8217;t reflect a composer&#8217;s, and a librettist&#8217;s, thinking about historical events?\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s another way in which I find computed-generated artworks unsatisfactory, particularly in music. AI-generated music is often interesting over the short term, but fails at larger-scale structure. Much of music history, from four-bar blues to Beethoven&#8217;s massive experiments in sonata form, is about building structures that can be interesting over the long term, whether &#8220;long term&#8221; means a few minutes of a blues song to several hours of opera. That was Beethoven&#8217;s project; more recently, it was the project of rock groups like Pink Floyd. It seems conceivable that a model could learn to generate such longer-form structures, but I&#8217;ve yet to see one that does it satisfactorily.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is this where collaboration between humans and machines comes in, and if so, what does that say about creativity? A machine could conceivably do the pattern-matching and combinatorics, assembling a creative work out of news clippings and stylistic mimicry. But a human still needs to supply the sense of history that makes the work something we care about. A human still needs to provide the structure that makes art works more than brief curiosities. Is it possible for a human could tweak a model like GPT-3 to give it that sense of direction and context? What kinds of user interfaces would facilitate this kind of interaction?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I can&#8217;t answer those questions, but that sounds like a much more interesting form of digital collaboration than having an algorithm write hundreds of dull poems or songs and “curating” a few that aren’t boring. That&#8217;s just a recipe for greeting-card sentiment and elevator music. I mean no disrespect to Hallmark—mass-produced poetry for greeting cards serves a purpose—but when we think about what kinds of creativity we want, and how that creativity will be mediated by AI, we should demand more.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/YrWZYgHiWmQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

       "               '<h2>AI Benefits and Stakeholders</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>AI is a field where value, in the form of outcomes and their resulting benefits, is created by machines exhibiting the ability to learn and “understand,” and to use the knowledge learned to carry out tasks or achieve goals. AI-generated benefits can be realized by defining and achieving appropriate goals. These goals depend on who the stakeholder is; in other words, the person or company receiving the benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are three potential stakeholders for AI applications, with a single application often involving all three. They are business stakeholders, customers, and users. Each type of stakeholder has different and unique goals; each group is most interested in having their specific objectives met, or problems solved. My book, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-for-people/9781492036562/\"><em>AI for People and Business</em></a>, introduces a framework that highlights the fact that both people and businesses can benefit from AI in unique and different ways.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A typical social media platform needs to satisfy all three stakeholders. In the case of Twitter, the business stakeholder’s top goals are likely centered around profits and revenue growth. Customer stakeholders are the people and companies that advertise on the platform, and are most concerned with ROI on their ad spend. User stakeholders are interested in benefiting from the platform&#8217;s functionality: staying up-to-date, quickly finding new people and topics to follow, and engaging with family and friends.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Goals should be defined specifically and at a granular level for each stakeholder and relevant use case. Twitter has no doubt went through this exercise long ago; but if we imagine Twitter taking its first steps towards AI, some specific and granular goals could be to build a recommendation engine that helps users find the most relevant people to follow (a goal for users), while also building an AI-powered advertising targeting engine that best matches ads with those most likely to be interested in the product or service being advertised (for customers). This in turn would increase the platform&#8217;s value for users and thus increase engagement, which would result in more eyes to see and interact with ads, which would mean better ROI on ad spend for customers, which would then achieve the goal of increased revenue and customer retention (for business stakeholders). The key is to start with small and easily identifiable AI projects that will trickle value upwards towards a company’s highest priority goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>AI Goals as a Function of Maturity</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For companies early in their AI journey, setting appropriate goals helps create a foundation from which to build AI maturity. It also helps companies learn how to translate existing AI capabilities into solving specific real-world problems and use cases. In my book, I introduce the Technical Maturity Model:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ysS_w5yak3mxD14drl8SHqE9_de9IUqXb18lgIhjvDCbI65Vfie2jMcnKWtf4IxU_gw5MqJO5_tIqacnGZ4j7FneyYUFQ673sUdRlPyZodDy33fJ2o3nyHKPagON5zv5nr-qCgjx\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I define technical maturity as a combination of three factors at a given point of time. These factors are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Experience: More experience usually results in increased muscle memory, faster progress, and greater efficiency. Teams with more experience with techniques such as natural language processing and computer vision are more likely to be successful building new applications using the same techniques. They’re not new to the field; they’ve solved problems, and have discovered what does and doesn’t work.</li><li>Technical sophistication: Sophistication measures a team’s ability to use advanced tools and techniques (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning). When new tools appear, they can decide quickly whether they’re worth while, and get up to speed. They’re on top of the research, and are capable of evaluating and experimenting with new ideas.</li><li>Technical competence: Competence measures a team’s ability to successfully deliver on initiatives and projects.\\xa0 They have previously built similar, successful AI applications, and are thus highly confident and relatively accurate in estimating the time, effort, and cost required to deliver again. Technical competence results in reduced risk and uncertainty.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a lot of overlap between these factors.\\xa0 Defining them precisely isn’t as important as the fact that you need all three. Higher levels of experience, technical sophistication, and technical competence increase technical maturity. Increased AI technical maturity boosts certainty and confidence, which in turn, results in better and more efficient AI-powered outcomes and success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technical maturity is a major factor behind why some companies are very successful with AI, while other companies struggle to get started and/or achieve success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Challenge with Defining AI Goals</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Turning an AI idea into actual benefits is difficult and requires the “right” goals, leadership, expertise, and approach. It also requires buy-in and alignment at the C-level.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Identifying, prioritizing, and goal-setting for AI opportunities is a multi-functional team effort that should include business folks, domain experts, and AI practitioners and researchers. This helps ensure alignment with company goals, while also including necessary business and domain expertise. AI initiatives may also require significant considerations for governance, compliance, ethics, cost, and risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Further, while the technical details of AI are complex, the outputs of AI techniques are relatively simple. In most cases, AI solutions are built to map a set of inputs to one or more outputs, where the outputs fall into a small group of possibilities. Outputs from trained AI models include numbers (continuous or discrete), categories or classes (e.g., spam or not-spam), probabilities, groups/segments, or a sequence (e.g., characters, words, or sentences).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Therefore, AI techniques don’t just solve real-world problems out of the box. They don’t automatically generate revenue and growth, maximize ROI, or keep users engaged and loyal. Likewise, AI doesn’t inherently optimize supply chains, detect diseases, drive cars, augment human intelligence, or tailor promotions to different market segments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Setting a company-wide goal of reducing customer churn by 25% is great, but, unfortunately, is far too broad for most AI applications. That’s why customer churn reduction is not a natural output of AI techniques. The mismatch between goals like reducing customer churn and actual AI outputs must be properly handled and mapped.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Why and How to Set Good AI Goals</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI goals should be appropriate for a given company&#8217;s technical maturity, and should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of success, prove value, and build a foundation from which to create increasingly sophisticated AI solutions that achieve higher-level business goals. A crawl, walk, run approach is a good analogy for this.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Goals should be well-formed, meaning they are stakeholder-specific, map actual AI outputs to applications and use cases that achieve business goals, and are appropriately sized. For companies early in their AI maturity, appropriately-sized goals mean that they should be small and specific enough to experiment with, and prove potential value from, relatively quickly (think lean methodologies and incremental). As AI maturity increases, a non-incremental, holistic, and organization-wide AI vision and strategy should be created to achieve hierarchically-aligned AI goals of varying granularity—goals that drive all AI initiatives and development. This should be accompanied by a transition from incremental thinking to big vision, “<a href=\"https://www.innoarchitech.com/blog/applied-artificial-intelligence-ai-transformation-aipb-framework\">applied AI transformation</a>” thinking.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s consider the overall goal of reducing customer churn. In an early stage of AI maturity, we can build AI solutions that reduce search friction (e.g., Netflix and Amazon recommendation engines), increase stickiness through personalized promotions and content that is more relevant and engaging, create a predictive model to identify customers most likely to churn and take appropriate preventative actions, or automate and optimize results in areas that are outside of a person’s primary area of expertise (e.g., automated retirement portfolio rebalancing and maximized ROI). When transitioning to developing a bigger AI vision and strategy, we may create a prioritized product roadmap consisting of a suite of recommendation engines and an AI-based personalized loyalty program, for example.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At the individual goal level, and for each well-formed goal, the same multi-functional team mentioned earlier must work collaboratively to determine what AI opportunities are available, select and prioritize the ones to pursue, and determine the technical feasibility of each.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are frameworks like<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm\"> SMART</a> to help characterize well-formed goals, but since AI is a field that I characterize as scientific innovation (like R&amp;D), characteristics like being achievable and time-bound may not be the best goals. Results are typically achieved through a scientific process of discovery, exploration, and experimentation, and these processes are not always predictable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the scientific nature of AI, goals are better expressed as well-posed questions and hypotheses around a specific and intended benefit or outcome for a certain stakeholder. With well-formed goals, data scientists and machine learning engineers can then apply the scientific method to test different approaches in order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, and assess whether a given approach is feasible and can achieve the goal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, by introducing the “Frequently bought together” recommendations (and other recommendations), Amazon was able to increase average customer shopping cart size and order amount (i.e., up-sell and cross-sell), which in turn increases average revenue per customer, which in turn increases Amazon’s e-commerce generated revenue per quarter. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers\">McKinsey estimates</a> that up to 35% of Amazon’s revenue and 75% of everything watched on Netflix comes from AI-powered recommendations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But when defining an AI project, the goal or hypothesis in this case isn’t to increase top-line revenue for the company, but rather to posit that building an application that groups products by likelihood to be purchased together will increase average customer order size, which in turn will have an upward impact on top level goals like increasing average revenue per customer and top-line revenue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another example would be setting a goal around building a well-performing AI model that can predict demand (number of units likely to be purchased) for a specific product for a given day, time, and weather conditions. If accurate, this prediction can help a retailer ensure that they do not run out of stock, which means that there is no lost revenue because a product is out of stock. An added benefit is improved customer experience, which results in happier and more loyal customers who are able to buy the products they want whenever they want to buy it. This same approach can be applied to virtually any other application of AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI and machine learning technologies have come a long way in terms of capabilities and accessibility, but off-the-shelf AI solutions aren’t yet available for specific industries or business domains, companies, sets of data, applications, and use cases. The key to success with AI is assembling a multi-functional team that defines appropriate goals, then letting these goals drive the AI initiatives and projects.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/gCrDHy2O2XE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

This is a significant problem: neither of us were aware of any significant work on user interfaces that support collaboration. However, as software developers, many of us have been practicing effective collaboration for years. It&#8217;s called pair programming, and it&#8217;s not at all like the models we&#8217;ve seen for interaction between an AI system and a human.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most AI systems we’ve seen envision AI as an oracle: you give it the input, it pops out the answer. It’s a unidirectional flow from the source to the destination. This model has many problems; for example, one reason medical doctors have been slow to accept AI may be that <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-01-people-dont-aihere.html\">it&#8217;s good at giving you the obvious solution</a> (&#8220;that rash is poison ivy&#8221;), at which point the doctor says &#8220;I knew that&#8230;&#8221; Or it gives you a different solution, to which the doctor says &#8220;That&#8217;s wrong.&#8221; Doctors worry that AI will “<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/15/artificial-intelligence-patient-consent-hospitals/\">derail clinicians’ conversations with patients</a>,” hinting that oracles are unwelcome in the exam room (unless they’re human). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shortly after IBM&#8217;s Watson beat the world Jeopardy champions, IBM invited me to see a presentation about it. For me, the <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/02/watson-machine-learning.html\">most interesting part</a> wasn&#8217;t the Jeopardy game Watson played against some IBM employees; it was when they showed the set of answers Watson considered before selecting its answer, weighted with their probabilities. That level was the real gold.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t need an AI system to tell us something obvious, or something we can Google in a matter of seconds. We need AI when the obvious answer isn&#8217;t the right one, and one of the possible but rejected answers is.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What we really need is the ability to have a dialog with the machine. We still don&#8217;t have the user interface for that. We don&#8217;t need complete, perfect solutions; we need partial solutions in situations where we don&#8217;t have all the information, and we need the ability to explore those solutions with an (artificially) intelligent partner. What is the logic behind the second, third, fourth, and fifth solutions? If we know the most likely solution is wrong, what’s next? Life is not like a game of Chess or Go—or, for that matter, Jeopardy. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What would this look like? One of the most important contributions of Extreme Programming and other Agile approaches was that they weren’t unidirectional. These methodologies stressed iteration: building something useful, demo-ing it to the customer, taking feedback, and then improving. Compared to Waterfall, Agile gave up on the master plan and specification that governed the project&#8217;s shape from start to finish, in favor of many mid-course corrections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That cyclic process, which is about collaboration between software developers and customers, may be exactly what we need to get beyond the &#8220;AI as Oracle&#8221; interaction. We don&#8217;t need a prescriptive AI writing code; we need a round trip, in which the AI makes suggestions, the programmer refines those suggestions, and together, they work towards a solution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That solution is probably embedded in an IDE. Programmers might start with a rough description of what they want to do, in an imprecise, ambiguous language like English. The AI could respond with a sketch of what the solution might look like, possibly in pseudo-code. The programmer could then continue by filling in the actual code, possibly with extensive code completion (and yes, based on a model trained on all the code in GitHub or whatever). At this point, the IDE could translate the programmer&#8217;s code back into pseudo-code, using a tool like <a href=\"http://www.phontron.com/paper/fudaba15asedemo.pdf\">&nbsp;Pseudogen</a> (a promising new tool, though still experimental). Any writer, whether of prose or of code, knows that having someone tell you what they think you meant does wonders for revealing your own lapses in understanding.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05265.pdf\">MISIM</a> is another research project that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/29/1005768/neural-network-similarities-between-programs-help-computers-code-themselves-ai-intel/\">envisions a collaborative role for AI</a>.&nbsp; It watches the code that a developer is writing, extracting its meaning and comparing it with similar code.&nbsp; It then makes suggestions about rewriting code that looks buggy or inefficient, based on the structure of similar programs. Although its creators suggest that MISIM could eventually lead to machines that program themselves, that’s not what interests me; I’m more interested in the idea that MISIM is helping a human to write better code. AI is still not very good at detecting and fixing bugs; but it is very good at asking a programmer to think carefully when it looks like something is wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is this pair programming with a machine? Maybe.&nbsp; It is definitely enlisting the machine as a collaborator, rather than as a surrogate. The goal isn&#8217;t to replace the programmers, but to make programmers better, to work in ways that are faster and more effective.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Will it work? I don&#8217;t know; we haven&#8217;t built anything like it yet. It&#8217;s time to try.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Qo_8toOwdLA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

And what does this mean for our purchase patterns and business models?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Welcome to Uncertainty</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You&#8217;re used to a certain level of uncertainty in your life, sure.&nbsp; But the pandemic has quickly turned up the uncertainty on even basic planning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your dishwasher, piano, or clothes dryer is making an odd sound. Do you proactively call a repair service to check it out?&nbsp; Your ounce of prevention will also cost you two weeks&#8217; wondering whether the repair technician was an asymptomatic carrier.&nbsp; If you hold off, you&#8217;re placing a bet that the appliance lasts long enough for treatment to become widely available, because you certainly don&#8217;t want it to break down just as infection rates spike.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stresses on a system reveal that some of our constants were really variables in disguise.&nbsp; &#8220;I can always leave my house.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;I can get to the gym on Friday.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;If I don&#8217;t go grocery shopping tonight, I can always do it tomorrow.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;ll run out of food.&#8221;&nbsp; These weren&#8217;t exactly bold statements in January. &nbsp; But by March, many cities&#8217; shelter-in-place orders had turned those periods into question marks. Even as cities are starting to relax those restrictions, there&#8217;s the worry that they may suddenly return as the virus continues to spread.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As this reality sets in, some of us are even weighing what we call &#8220;acceptance purchases&#8221;: items which show that we&#8217;re in this for the long haul.&nbsp; Your gym isn&#8217;t closed, but it&#8217;s <em>as good as closed</em> since the city can quickly order it to shut down if local case counts climb again.&nbsp; So maybe it&#8217;s time to buy that fancy exercise bike.&nbsp; And ride-hailing services were appealing until using them increased your exposure to the virus.&nbsp; Maybe now you&#8217;ll buy that car you sometimes think about?&nbsp; You had considered downsizing your home, but you&#8217;ll appreciate the extra space if you&#8217;re spending more time indoors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Those sorts of purchases are meant to last you for years, though, which means they&#8217;re only wise investments if the pandemic (and its impact on the local economy) continues for a long time.&nbsp; What if we see improved prevention or widespread treatment within a few months?&nbsp; Do we want to try to offload an exercise bike or a car that we no longer need? The longer you hold off on making those decisions, the greater the chances that you&#8217;ll make those purchases too late.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to make a decision when you can&#8217;t rely on your near-term world falling within some certain, predictable scope.&nbsp; You try to keep all of your options open at all times so that you can be ready for any possibility.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s a lot of extra strain on your brain.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s tiring.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Your house just got smaller</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The pandemic has made a number of businesses less desirable or outright inaccessible.&nbsp; Doing that work yourself reduces the impact around the uncertainty of when they&#8217;ll return.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also a lot more responsibility for you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Congratulations on running a restaurant, cafe, bar, cinema, gym, school, daycare, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mvolpe/status/1294644899489419272\">office</a>, and storage facility.&nbsp; You get to buy workout equipment, cooking gear, hair care tools, teaching supplies, and anything else needed to backfill services to which you used to outsource. You&#8217;re responsible for the decisions on which models of equipment to buy, as well as the upkeep thereof. You suddenly need to know a lot of things about a lot of things, but you don&#8217;t have the time to become an expert in any one of them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Welcome to the diseconomies of non-scale: being small and self-sufficient is expensive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like a factory, hotel event space, or a fast-food kitchen, you find yourself constantly partitioning or re-tooling rooms to compensate for your limited space.&nbsp; The gym becomes the reading room becomes the video meeting space becomes the work area.&nbsp; (You and your spouse flip a coin to see who gets the <em>real</em> office and who gets that basement corner.&nbsp; Hint: if you want the nicer space, make sure you&#8217;re on more video calls. And pretend that you can&#8217;t get Zoom backgrounds to work.) The kitchen table flips between a dining area and a school, three times a day.&nbsp; The bathroom becomes the hair salon every week and quickly switches back again.&nbsp; All of these swaps take time, effort, and mental energy, what economists collectively refer to as <em>switching costs.</em>&nbsp; They add up. Quickly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nor is this just about the size of the home.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a matter of how much you were using it before the pandemic started, the number of spaces present, and the ratio of people to square feet.&nbsp; If you live in a sprawling, suburban house, but every room was already dedicated to some function or someone&#8217;s personal space, then you&#8217;re just marginally better off than the person occupying a small, urban apartment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just about &#8220;working from home,&#8221; either.&nbsp; That usually means that you have a space set aside in your house to work and to take calls, and you have the house to yourself during working hours. Experienced remote-work professionals will tell you that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dotmariusz/status/1287884297072852993\">we&#8217;re living a very different scenario</a>.&nbsp; This increasing need to run a standalone, be-everything home means that we are suffering from the curse of generalism: we&#8217;re our children&#8217;s teachers, our cooks, our housekeepers, our barbers, our IT department, and our fix-it crew.&nbsp; We&#8217;re becoming more self-sufficient, but at the expense of having less time to specialize in our main jobs. All of this means that we&#8217;re spending a lot of time just getting by, and not much time advancing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Connections as Currency: Getting By and Getting Supplies</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In most places, you don&#8217;t need to be &#8220;connected&#8221; to get by day-to-day.&nbsp; Whom you know is less important because, with even a modest income, you can get most of what you need.&nbsp; You mostly care about diversifying your professional network, because that helps you to find a new job, which is what provides you the money that allows you to compensate for not knowing anyone else.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When a pandemic triggers stresses in our supply chains, that idea breaks down.&nbsp; Whom you&nbsp; know in your <em>personal</em> sphere suddenly counts a lot more.&nbsp; Instead of money, it&#8217;s your social network that gets you through the day.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Do you know someone whose job gives them leading indicators on the spread of the virus?&nbsp; Early in the pandemic, friends of medical professionals got some advance warning of what was to come.&nbsp; They could gather information from their professional spheres to let their personal networks know that something nasty was brewing.&nbsp; The same holds for anyone whose business sells protective gear or cleaning supplies.&nbsp; Over casual drinks, they might mention: &#8220;It&#8217;s weird … we&#8217;re getting a lot of new orders, and not from our usual customers.&nbsp; Something&#8217;s up.&nbsp; You may want to buy some extras, just in case.&#8221;&nbsp; (This, by the by, shows the value of keeping an eye on your company&#8217;s data.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have systems to tell you when your sales numbers are abnormal, you may miss information that you already had in-hand.&nbsp; And in this case, it would have been time-sensitive info.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Communities of shared experience are home to these socially-strong yet professionally-diverse networks.&nbsp; Family and close friendships top the list, with religious and ethnic ties running a close second.&nbsp; (People who were part of the same wave of immigration from the same country often forge ties that are as strong as family.)&nbsp; Neighbors and people who share a hobby are also in there, though to a lesser degree. Within these groups there&#8217;s always somebody who has a quick tip, someone who &#8220;knows a guy,&#8221; someone you can pull aside for a quick &#8220;Hey can I ask you about …&#8221;&nbsp; Maybe your niece works at a big grocery chain, and she can tell you when the shipments of hand sanitizer arrive.&nbsp; In December, this would have been a trivial mention.&nbsp; Today, when goods are scarce, this is timely information and it can make a difference.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Personal networks often have the benefit of being geographically dispersed.&nbsp;Your best friend can ship you cleaning supplies, since they are plentiful in his part of the country.&nbsp; Your extended family, which stretches from Paris to Singapore, can tell you how their cities are handling shelter-in-place rules.&nbsp; Chatting with those far-flung aunts and uncles gives you several weeks&#8217; advance notice on how <em>your</em> city&#8217;s rules may turn out.&nbsp; That reduces your uncertainty, which makes it easier for you to prepare, which reduces your stress and decision fatigue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your ability to forge new relationships can compensate for a smaller social network.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have a relative who works at Target, you can ask someone who works there, so long as you have the skill to spot <em>whom</em> to ask.&nbsp; You have to be able to read people, to see who would be receptive to that question. And you also need to tell whether this would be a simple favor, or something that merits monetary compensation.&nbsp; The value on that information just increased by a wide margin; shouldn&#8217;t the price follow?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Relationship-building also counts in the B2B setting.&nbsp; Such was the case with grocery chain Trader Joe&#8217;s.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve managed to avoid shortages during this pandemic, most notably in toilet paper.&nbsp; When other stores seemed to run out, Trader Joe&#8217;s always magically had some in stock.&nbsp; That&#8217;s because they were able to <a href=\"https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/trader-joes-talks-supply-chain-tp-return-normalcy\">strike a deal with an unnamed hotel chain</a> to buy supplies that were going unused due to dramatic cuts in travel. Granted, Trader Joe&#8217;s very business model—white-labeling manufacturers&#8217; goods—smoothed this road.&nbsp; But their ability to forge that relationship counted just as much as their ability to execute on selling the goods.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Challenges to Come: Tracing the Chains</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can reduce our pandemic-driven stresses by reducing the uncertainty.&nbsp; To do that, we can trace chains of knock-on effects to determine what changes are coming, and plan accordingly. &nbsp; For example:&nbsp; &#8220;many restaurants have closed up,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;there&#8217;s less waste from restaurants,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;there&#8217;s less food for rats,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/cdc-coronavirus-rats.html\">expect rats to get more bold</a>.&#8221;&nbsp; So be careful when taking out your trash.&nbsp; &#8220;The pandemic has drastically cut air travel,&#8221; therefore &#8220;airlines will have less revenue,&#8221; therefore &#8220;airlines will furlough employees,&#8221; therefore &#8220;businesses those employees patronized—from in-airport restaurants to hotel shuttle services to their at-home economies—will suffer.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Though we can trace just one chain of effects at a time, multiple paths spin out of every <em>&#8220;what next?</em>&#8221; and spread out like a spider-crack in a window.&nbsp; They connect down the line to weave a fabric of impacts. Case in point: WSJ&#8217;s Scott McCartney points out that the sudden drop in air travel has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-has-upended-everything-airlines-know-about-pricing-11596632998\">upset airlines&#8217; ability to set prices</a>, since they take such a data-driven approach. People who work in the ML/AI field will tell you that this is not just an airline problem: a sudden shift will upend <em>any</em> predictive models built on past behaviors, regardless of industry.&nbsp; That will affect <em>other</em> fields&#8217; dynamic pricing, yes, but also fraud detection (your credit card reflects a lot of outlier purchases, times, and locations since February) and demand forecasts (a knock-on effect of our collective outlier purchases).&nbsp; That, in turn, ties to inventory management, which is tied to supply chains, which involve all of the players in the shipping industry, which is tied to fuel consumption and vehicle maintenance&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any tightly-coupled, complex system, all of these connections work in our favor until they suddenly don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Expect pandemic-related changes to cascade, revealing both endogenous and systemic problems that are related in unexpected ways.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One problem with tight coupling, Charles Perrow notes in <em>Normal Accidents</em>, is that materials only have one path to take through the system.&nbsp; If a component in the middle breaks, everything backs up so the entire system is as good as broken.&nbsp; You can repair or re-create the old paths (when possible) or create new connections between components.&nbsp; In Covid-speak, that means our long-term solutions fall into &#8220;partially restoring and re-thinking the pre-pandemic life&#8221; and &#8220;creating new ways to handle the day-to-day when there&#8217;s a highly infectious disease running around.&#8221;&nbsp; There are business opportunities in both camps.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Covid as a Forcing Function: New Opportunities To Handle Pandemic Life<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We mostly assume the phrases &#8220;contactless&#8221; and &#8220;touch-free&#8221; refer to electronic payments.&nbsp; Those are very much in demand right now, but the touch-free space now extends to the wider notion of <em>strangers not interacting in-person, and not handling the same objects at the same time.</em>&nbsp; That opens the door to online learning, telemedicine, tele-anything.&nbsp; If you can provide your service at a distance, you have a lot of new prospects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Entertainment already had a firm footing in the online world thanks to video streaming services. The pandemic, and its dramatically reduced cinema attendance, has provided them even more leverage as <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/07/universal-amc-theatres-theatrical-window-crush-pvod-agreement-1202997573/\">some movies will have a shorter time on the big screen</a> before they shift to online video.&nbsp; (As a side note, there&#8217;s another chain of knock-on effects to explore: since studios have been known to time releases to coincide with certain seasons and to have a better shot at industry awards, how will that change when films head into living rooms that much sooner?)&nbsp; Other groups, like Chicago&#8217;s Lyric Opera and New York&#8217;s Met Opera, are hosting performances online as their subscribers can no longer attend in-person.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s become more difficult for performances that rely on people being in the same space. Stand-up comedians from Nimesh Patel to Dave Chappelle have recently been able to pull off outdoor gigs with live-but-socially-distanced audiences. Fire-spinning and belly-dance performer Dawn Xiana Moon, of Raks Inferno and Raks Geek, combined multiple streaming services to simulate all of her performers being &#8220;on-stage&#8221; at the same time. This required her to leverage her technology background, a skill set that is admittedly rare in the live-act world, and she&#8217;d still prefer a single platform that just works. By comparison, TV and movie studios have yet to explain how they will manage to film while keeping cast and crew socially distant. The bottom line is that companies that create tools to improve filming multiple, simultaneous, geographically-dispersed teams will have a lot of customers.&nbsp; (And for movies, will we see an increase in animation to fill the gap?)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>People are also demanding more of their home internet infrastructure to support increased school- and work-related loads.&nbsp; (The authors know several people who have shelled out to their ISPs for greater bandwidth.)&nbsp; That also means a greater load on mid-tier services like social media sites, videoconference services, and the aforementioned streaming video platforms.&nbsp; If you sell networking hardware or provide network operations services to those companies, you will have no shortage of work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If the pandemic continues long enough, we expect to see a deeper penetration of home broadband service, especially wireless broadband.&nbsp; This is another touch-free offering, as it permits your provider to establish and troubleshoot internet connectivity issues without sending a technician into your home.&nbsp; (As another knock-on effect, this means providers will be able to limit field technicians&#8217; service radius to their towers and datacenters, which should let them cover more territory on the same number of staff.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional, multi-year lease commercial real estate was already experiencing disruption due to coworking spaces.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll now both suffer as companies rethink their post-pandemic office needs.&nbsp; Doubly so since some newly-remote workers are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21277254/tech-silicon-valley-remote-work-exodus-facebook-google-coronavirus-future\">taking the opportunity to move out of state</a>. (Yet another knock-on effect: without office workers, what will happen to the lunch spots and bars that lined the dense urban-business landscape?)&nbsp; You also have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/nyregion/nyc-economy-chain-stores.html\">retailers abandoning spaces</a> since there are far too few customers to browse stores. Two types of consumers may pick up that inventory, though.&nbsp; The first, in the short term, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-and-giant-mall-operator-look-at-turning-sears-j-c-penney-stores-into-fulfillment-centers-11596992863\">Amazon may convert some old mall spaces into distribution centers</a>. Other businesses will undoubtedly find ways to repurpose empty urban office spaces at deep-discount prices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, and in the longer term, we&#8217;ll accept that our homes are simply not large enough to be our Everything Place.&nbsp; People who choose to remain in dense urban environments will want their apartments to be more like standalone houses, which means having space for in-unit washer/dryer, multiple bathrooms, and multiple rooms to serve as offices. Perhaps cities will divvy up old office buildings into large apartments to meet that need.&nbsp; That&#8217;s admittedly more of a stretch, if for no other reason than the time scale involved for the construction effort and the zoning law changes.&nbsp; For now, some percentage of urban residents will simply pack up for the suburbs, or even more rural areas out of state. Let&#8217;s face it: if the restaurant scene has dwindled and public transit feels like too much of a coronavirus risk, then urban living has lost a lot of its luster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Wherever we choose to live, we&#8217;ll need more support for running our homes.&nbsp; This will include ways to make the most of our limited space, such as smaller-scale workout equipment and compact storage, and increased support for DIY repairs, like video tutorials from manufacturers on how to service their products.&nbsp; This is another stretch, but if the pandemic lasts long enough, manufacturers will modify their products to make them easier to service.&nbsp; That, or cheaper to just throw away and replace when they encounter a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The difficulties of schooling don&#8217;t end with table space and bandwidth needs.&nbsp; There are also the socioemotional concerns such as college students learning how to live away from home, and how the K-12 set learns to socialize when they don&#8217;t interact in person.&nbsp; Not to mention, who will do the teaching?&nbsp; In March, when stay-at-home orders started to hit US cities, many parents suddenly had to balance their full-time jobs with being full-time teachers.&nbsp; (Technology consultants Sarah Aslanifar and Bobby Norton jokingly refer to their new roles as, &#8220;working from home-school.&#8221;)&nbsp; Businesses took a double hit as they had to scramble to find a way for people to work from home, and then those same people spent the next several weeks distracted during the workday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some parents have since formed social &#8220;pods&#8221; with neighbors whom they trust to perform compatible pandemic hygiene.&nbsp; Some of those have evolved into <em>educational</em> pods, wherein parents spring for someone to teach their group of kids.&nbsp; An article in MIT Tech Review mentions a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/30/1005810/american-parents-are-setting-up-homeschool-pandemic-pods-microschool/\">price tag of $10,000 per student, per semester</a>.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t accessible to everyone; but for high-earning parents, it&#8217;s a simple economic decision: the cost to outsource schooling is smaller than the amount of money they&#8217;ll earn when they can perform their day jobs at full capacity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Higher education was already experiencing some disruption—boot camps and certificate programs on one end, and students questioning their post-college job prospects on the other—and the onset of the pandemic has increased the pressure.&nbsp; This goes beyond the last few months of sorting out whether and how to open campuses for autumn 2020.&nbsp; Parents and students alike also question the price tag of a fancy four-year college when students will be attending classes from their kitchen table.&nbsp; (One <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLLU3LvK_Hc\">SNL sketch</a> framed the experience as &#8220;University of Phoenix Online, with worse tech support.&#8221;)&nbsp; For the time being, colleges can busy themselves by shoring up courseware and videoconferencing platforms in order to set autumn 2020 classes in motion.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll quickly need to sort out other near-term concerns (shoring up lost profits from empty student housing) as well as their future prospects (demonstrating their value compared to vocational programs, especially if the job market suffers over the long term). &nbsp; If schools can&#8217;t sort this out on their own, they&#8217;ll likely pay someone to sort it out for them.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also a business opportunity in providing a centralized, one-stop SaaS platform such that colleges won&#8217;t have to cobble together their own with a mix of one-off tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One silver lining of working from home is that your job prospects just opened up.&nbsp; Covid-19 has forced a lot of companies to admit that the old &#8220;this work can&#8217;t be done from home&#8221; excuse doesn&#8217;t hold up.&nbsp; Some of them are even starting to <em>like</em> it: they see how much money they were burning on an office for people who already knew they&#8217;d be more effective working from home.&nbsp; Many of them will scratch that line item from next year&#8217;s budget.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This means we&#8217;ll see more remote hiring in the sectors that can support it.&nbsp; That will establish a clear boundary between the companies that see the benefits (&#8220;we&#8217;re now able to hire across the country for these hard-to-fill roles&#8221;) and those that do not (&#8220;we&#8217;re only hiring people who live in this city, for when we go back to the office&#8221;).&nbsp; Big tech-sector names like Google and Facebook have already announced plans to extend work-from-home support, while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/twitter-tells-employees-they-can-work-from-home-forever.html\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/atlassian-tells-employees-they-can-work-from-home-indefinitely.html\">Atlassian</a> have flat-out said that their crews can work from home indefinitely.&nbsp; In some fields, failing to provide a remote-work option may limit your talent pool.&nbsp; It will be the equivalent of running an office space in the suburbs when most companies, and their prospective employees, exist in the dense urban center and have no desire to commute.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Bringing Back (Pieces of) &#8220;The Old Normal&#8221;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just as we&#8217;ll pay for help adapting to the current state of things, we&#8217;ll also pay for some semblance of &#8220;the old normal.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>People generally like meeting up, whether one-on-one for a tea or in larger groups for a party.&nbsp; We&#8217;re already using videoconferencing tools to hang out with friends and family, and to attend events.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re adapting to the tools more than the other way around.&nbsp; Right now services like Hangouts, Meet, and&nbsp; Zoom are still very much designed for, well, video versions of office conference calls: one person speaks at a time, and you get a &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8221; grid view of attendees.&nbsp; Expect the incumbent vendors as well as new upstarts to create tools that are better suited for [specific interaction]-over-video, like conferences, classroom teaching, or music lessons.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&#8217;re really feeling this in online conferences.&nbsp; While webinar tools fulfill the mission of letting a person deliver a talk to a large number of attendees, they don&#8217;t support other aspects of an in-person event.&nbsp; Randomly bumping into people and &#8220;hallway track&#8221; sessions have forged long-term bonds between conference attendees, far more than the talks themselves.&nbsp; This could serve as a driver for VR, as that will take us away from &#8220;attending events from our living room&#8221; to &#8220;being in our living room, but actually attending events in a dedicated space.&#8221;&nbsp; There is a big difference.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another reason people meet up is to play games.&nbsp; Online games are nothing new, and they&#8217;ve even gained some mainstream street cred thanks to casual gaming.&nbsp; Expect to see improved coordination, such that you can play with people of your choosing (a feature lacking in a number of iOS Game Center offerings).&nbsp; People playing more video games may also lead to greater participation in esports leagues, and even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/video-game-meetings.html\">taking business meetings over a gaming session</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In-person interaction is our most risky form of socializing at the moment, but it&#8217;s also the one people want the most. Goods and services that help us to (safely) meet face-to-face will not just help us on an emotional level, but they could play a key role in helping the economy get back on its feet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have masks and face shields, which are good for being in public.&nbsp; What about protective overgarments, reminiscent of 1950s interpretations of outer-space wear?&nbsp; We could wear them to protect our entire body in public transit or airplanes, and then shed them before entering a friend&#8217;s home.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also the down-to-earth business of designing and installing plastic shields between restaurant tables.&nbsp; Maybe someone will create transparent, oversized cabins that allow you and a few trusted friends to be &#8220;on the beach&#8221; but still be indoors and away from others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meeting in person also counts for office space.&nbsp; In a work-from-home world, some teams still prefer the in-person experience.&nbsp; What can we do to make it safer to be in the office, beyond standing several feet apart at all times?&nbsp; An effective but low-tech offering could involve installing protective shields around conference tables (not unlike what we see in some restaurants) or modifying office layouts to discourage crowding.&nbsp; The next step up would increase touch-free actions, such as choosing your elevator floor through a smartphone app.&nbsp; Larger and higher-tech offerings would go deep into the guts of the building to install virus purifiers in building HVAC systems and the accompanying ductwork.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>What Next?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Where do we go from here?&nbsp; That depends how long we go without treatment or improved preventative measures.&nbsp; One thing&#8217;s for sure: Covid-19 is a driver of change.&nbsp; There is no more &#8220;normal&#8221; in terms of how we shop for groceries, attend events, or even lay out our homes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s up to us to adapt to our present, even as that present continues to change, and that will influence how we decide what to buy and sell.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How much we change, as people, depends on how long the pandemic lasts.&nbsp; It&#8217;s possible that it will carve deep grooves in our collective social memory, similar to the Great Depression, and its impact will influence how people behave long after the disease is a threat.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It also depends on how much we are willing to adapt.&nbsp; That is a function of how soon we&#8217;re willing to let go of &#8220;normal,&#8221; which is really a euphemism for &#8220;the past.&#8221;&nbsp; Especially since the past is heavily mythologized.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/BvVhg_lRVhg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

That is, products that are laser-focused on one aspect of the data science and machine learning workflows, in contrast to all-in-one platforms that attempt to solve the entire space of data workflows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article, which examines this shift in more depth, is an opinionated result of countless conversations with data scientists about their needs in modern data science workflows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Two Cultures of Data Tooling</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Today we see two different kinds of offerings in the marketplace:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li><strong>All-in-one platforms</strong> like Amazon Sagemaker, AzureML, Cloudera Data Science Workbench, and Databricks (which is now a unified analytics platform);<br></li><li><strong>Best of Breed</strong> products that are laser-focused on one aspect of the data science or the machine learning process like Snowflake, Confluent/Kafka, MongoDB/Atlas, Coiled/Dask and Plotly.<sup>1</sup></li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Integrated all-in-one platforms assemble many tools together, and can therefore provide a full solution to common workflows. They’re reliable and steady, but they tend not to be exceptional at any part of that workflow and they tend to move slowly. For this reason, such platforms may be a good choice for companies that don&#8217;t have the culture or skills to assemble their own platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In contrast, best-of-breed products take a more craftsman approach: they do one thing well and move quickly (often they are the ones driving technological change). They usually meet the needs of end users more effectively, are cheaper, and easier to work with.&nbsp; However some assembly is required because they need to be used alongside other products to create full solutions.&nbsp; Best-of-breed products require a DIY spirit that may not be appropriate for slow-moving companies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Which path is best? This is an open question, but we’re putting our money on best-of-breed products. We’ll share why in a moment, but first, we want to look at a historical perspective with what happened to data warehouses and data engineering platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Lessons Learned from Data Warehouse and Data Engineering Platforms</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Historically, companies bought Oracle, SAS, Teradata or other data all-in-one data warehousing solutions. These were rock solid at what they did–and “what they did” includes offering packages that are valuable to other parts of the company, such as accounting–but it was difficult for customers to adapt to new workloads over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Next came data engineering platforms like Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR, which broke open the Oracle/SAS hegemony with open source tooling. These provided a greater level of flexibility with Hadoop, Hive, and Spark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, while Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR worked well for a set of common data engineering workloads, they didn’t generalize well to workloads that didn’t fit the MapReduce paradigm, including deep learning and new natural language models. As companies moved to cloud, embraced interactive Python, integrated GPUs, or moved to a greater diversity of data science and machine learning use cases, these data engineering platforms weren’t ideal. Data scientists rejected these platforms and went back to working on their laptops where they had full control to play around and experiment with new libraries and hardware.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While data engineering platforms provided a great place for companies to start building data assets, their rigidity becomes especially challenging when companies embrace data science and machine learning, both of which are highly dynamic fields with heavy churn that require much more flexibility in order to stay relevant. An all-in-one platform makes it easy to get started, but can become a problem when your data science practice outgrows it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So if data engineering platforms like Cloudera displaced data warehousing platforms like SAS/Oracle, what will displace Cloudera as we move into the data science/machine learning age?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Why we think Best-of-Breed will displace walled garden platforms</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The worlds of data science and machine learning move at a much faster pace than data warehousing and much of data engineering.&nbsp; All-in-one platforms are too large and rigid to keep up.&nbsp; Additionally, the benefits of integration are less relevant today with technologies like Kubernetes.&nbsp; Let’s dive into these reasons in more depth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data Science and Machine Learning Require Flexibility</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Data science” is an incredibly broad term that encompasses dozens of activities like ETL, machine learning, model management, and user interfaces, each of which have many rapidly evolving choices. Only <em>part</em> of a data scientist&#8217;s workflow is typically supported by even the most mature data science platforms. Any attempt to build a one-size-fits-all integrated platform would have to include such a wide range of features, and such a wide range of choices within each feature, that it would be extremely difficult to maintain and keep up to date.&nbsp; What happens when you want to incorporate real-time data feeds? What happens when you want to start analyzing time series data?&nbsp; Yes, the all-in-one platforms will have tools to meet these needs; but will they be the tools you want, or the tools you’d choose if you had the opportunity?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Consider user interfaces. Data scientists use many tools like Jupyter notebooks, IDEs, custom dashboards, text editors, and others throughout their day. Platforms offering only “Jupyter notebooks in the cloud” cover only a small fraction of what actual data scientists use in a given day. This leaves data scientists spending half of their time in the platform, half outside the platform, and a new third half migrating between the two environments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Consider also the computational libraries that all-in-one platforms support, and the speed at which they go out of date quickly. Famously, Cloudera ran Spark 1.6 for<em> years</em> after Spark 2.0 was released–even though (and perhaps because) Spark 2.0 was released only 6 months after 1.6. It’s quite hard for a platform to stay on top of all of the rapid changes that are happening today. They’re too broad and numerous to keep up with.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Kubernetes and the cloud commoditize integration</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the variety of data science has made all-in-one platforms harder, at the same time advances in infrastructure have made integrating best-of-breed products easier.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR were necessary at the time because Hadoop, Hive, and Spark were notoriously difficult to set up and coordinate. Companies that lacked technical skills needed to buy an integrated solution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But today things are different. Modern data technologies are simpler to set up and configure. Also, technologies like Kubernetes and the cloud help to commoditize configuration and reduce integration pains with many narrowly-scoped products. Kubernetes lowers the barrier to integrating new products, which allows modern companies to assimilate and retire best-of-breed products on an as-needed basis without a painful onboarding process. For example, Kubernetes helps data scientists deploy APIs that serve models (machine learning or otherwise), build machine learning workflow systems, and is an increasingly common substrate for web applications that allows data scientists to integrate OSS technologies, as reported <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1280344314741026817\">here</a> by Hamel Hussain, Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Github.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Kubernetes provides a common framework in which most deployment concerns can be specified programmatically.\\xa0 This puts more control into the hands of library authors, rather than individual integrators.\\xa0 As a result the work of integration is greatly reduced, often just specifying some configuration values and hitting deploy.\\xa0 A good example here is the <a href=\"https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Zero to JupyterHub guide</a>.\\xa0 Anyone with modest computer skills can deploy JupyterHub on Kubernetes without knowing too much in about an hour.\\xa0 Previously this would have taken a trained professional with pretty deep expertise several days.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We believe that companies that adopt a best-of-breed data platform will be more able to adapt to technology shifts that we know are coming. Rather than being tied into a monolithic data science platform on a multi-year time scale, they will be able to adopt, use, and swap out products as their needs change.&nbsp; Best of breed platforms enable companies to evolve and respond to today’s rapidly changing environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rise of the data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer and all the satellite roles that tie the decision function of organizations to data, along with increasing amounts of automation and machine intelligence, require tooling that meet these end users’ needs. These needs are rapidly evolving and tied to open source tooling that is also evolving rapidly. Our strong opinion (strongly held) is that best-of-breed platforms are better positioned to serve these rapidly evolving needs by building on these OSS tools than all-in-platforms. We look forward to finding out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Footnote</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>1</sup> Note that we’re discussing data platforms that are built on top of OSS technologies, rather than the OSS technologies themselves. This is not another Dask vs Spark post, but a piece weighing up the utility of two distinct types of modern data platforms.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/GAPekrvmT6E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

The programming languages we dread are a lot more interesting. As Tolstoy said, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what are these unhappy, unloved languages, and why do programmers dread using them? Given the chance it&#8217;s, well, hard to resist jumping in with some theories, and perhaps even saying something impolitic.&nbsp; Or defending some languages that are disliked for the wrong reasons.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More precisely, StackOverflow tabulated the &#8220;% of developers who are developing with the language or technology but have not expressed interest in continuing to do so.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound quite as dire as &#8220;dreaded&#8221;; &#8220;not expressing an interest in working with a language again&#8221; is a rather vague indication of dread. There are lots of things I’ve done that I’d rather not do again, including writing troff macros that spawned shell scripts. But we won&#8217;t worry about that, will we?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The list of least liked languages is similar to the lists of the most widely used languages, as indicated by <a href=\"https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/02/28/language-rankings-1-20/\">Redmonk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\">Tiobe</a> and, for that matter, searches on O&#8217;Reilly Learning. That’s no surprise; Bjarne Stroustrup said that “there are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.” And that makes a lot of sense, at least in relation to this survey. If you&#8217;ve got millions of users, it&#8217;s not hard to get a lot of people to dislike you. So seeing perennials like C alongside relative newcomers like Java on the list of disliked languages isn&#8217;t surprising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Kevlin Henney and I thought that the list of least liked languages also reflected the opinions of programmers who were working on large and legacy projects, as opposed to short programs. Dislike of a language may be “guilt by association”: dislike of a large, antiquated codebase with minimal documentation, and an architectural style in which every bug fixed breaks something else. Therefore, it’s not surprising to see languages that used to be widely used but have fallen from popularity on the list. And it’s also easy to fall in love with a quirky language that was perfect for one project, but that you’ll never see again.&nbsp; (In my case, that’s <a href=\"https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/icon/\">Icon</a>. Try it; you might like it. It’s not on anyone’s list.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What’s most surprising is when a language is out of place: when it’s significantly more or less disliked than you expect. That’s what I’d like to think about. So, having disposed of the preliminaries, here are a few observations:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Java</strong>: Java has been the language people love to hate since its birth. I was at the USENIX session in which James Gosling first spoke about Java (way before 1.0), and people left the room talking about how horrible Java was–none of whom had actually used the language because it hadn’t been released yet. Java comes in to this survey at a mild #9. Given Java’s reputation, that 9 should have hearts all over it.<br><br>If there’s one language on this list that’s associated with gigantic projects, it’s Java.&nbsp; And there are a lot of things to dislike about it—though a lot of them have to do with bad habits that grew up around Java, rather than the language itself. If you find yourself <a href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatternsConsideredHarmful\">abusing design patterns</a>, step back and look at what you&#8217;re doing; making everything into a design pattern is a sign that you didn’t understand what patterns are really for. (If you need a refresher, go to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/\">Head First Design Patterns</a> or the classic <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/\">Gang of Four book</a>.) If you start writing a FactoryFactoryFactory, stop and take a nice long walk. If you&#8217;re writing a ClassWithAReallyLongNameBecauseThatsHowWeDoIt, you don’t need to. Java doesn’t make you do that.&nbsp; Descriptive names are good; ridiculously long names (along with ridiculously deep package hierarchies) are not. I’ve always tried to put one coherent thought on each line of code. You can’t do that when the names are half a line long. But that’s not Java’s fault, it’s an odd cultural quirk of Java programmers.<br><br>Java is verbose, but that&#8217;s not necessarily a problem. As someone who is not a Java fan told me once, all those declarations at the start of a class are actually documentation, and that documentation is particularly important on big projects. Once you know what the data structures are, you can make a pretty good guess what the class does. I&#8217;ve found Java easier to read and understand than most other languages, in part because it’s so explicit—and most good programmers realize that they spend more time reading others&#8217; code than writing their own.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Ruby</strong>: I was very surprised to see Ruby as the #7 on the list. Ruby more disliked than Java?&nbsp; What’s going on? I&#8217;ve had some fun programming in Ruby; it is, for the most part, a &#8220;do what I meant, not what I said&#8221; language, and 15 years ago, that promise made lots of programmers fall in love.<br><br>But if we think about Ruby in the context of large systems, it makes sense. It&#8217;s not hard to write code that is ambiguous, at least to the casual observer. It&#8217;s very easy to run afoul of a function or method that has been &#8220;monkeypatched&#8221; to have some non-standard behavior, and those modifications are rarely documented. Metaprogramming has been used brilliantly in frameworks like Rails, but I&#8217;ve always been bothered by the &#8220;And now the magic happens&#8221; aspect of many Ruby libraries. These aren&#8217;t features that are conducive to large projects.<br><br>Many years ago, I heard someone at a Ruby or Rails conference say &#8220;There aren&#8217;t any large projects; everything in Ruby takes 90% fewer lines of code.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thought LOC was a foolish metric. And even if you believe that Ruby takes 90% fewer lines of code (I don’t), 10% of a big number is still a big number, particularly if it&#8217;s your responsibility to digest that code, including things happening behind your back.&nbsp; Ruby is a lot of fun, and I still use it for quick scripts (though I’ve largely switched to Python for those), but is it the language to choose for a big project? That might have me running in fear.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>R</strong>: R weighs in at #10 on the &#8220;dreaded list.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s because of a misperception. R both is, and is not, a general-purpose programming language. Several statisticians have told me &#8220;You programmers don&#8217;t get it. R is a statistics workbench, not a programming language. It&#8217;s not a weird version of Python.&#8221; I&#8217;ve played around with R any number of times, but I finally &#8220;got it&#8221; (well, at least partly) when I read through the R tutorial in Vince Buffalo&#8217;s <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/bioinformatics-data-skills/9781449367480/\">Bioinformatics Data Skills</a>. Loops and if statements are relegated to a couple of pages at the end of the tutorial, not one of the first concepts you learn. Why? Because if you&#8217;re using R correctly, you <em>don&#8217;t need them</em>. It’s designed so you don’t have to use them.&nbsp; If you come from a more traditional language, you may find yourself fighting against the language, not working with it. There are better approaches to conditional logic and iteration.<br><br>It also helps to use the best tools and libraries available: <a href=\"https://rstudio.com/\">RStudio</a> is a really nice integrated development environment for R, and the <a href=\"https://www.tidyverse.org/\">Tidyverse</a> is a great set of libraries for working with data. Ironically, that may even be part of the problem: with excellent graphics libraries and web frameworks, R suddenly looks a lot less like a specialized statistics workbench, and more like a general-purpose workhorse.<br><br>Lots of programmers seem to be taking another look at R–perhaps to analyze COVID data?&nbsp; R jumped from #20 on the <a href=\"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\">Tiobe index</a> to #8 in the July, 2020 report. That’s a huge change. Whatever the reason, R will be a much more pleasant environment if you work with it, rather than against it. It is very opinionated–and the opinions are of a statistician, rather than a programmer.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Python</strong>: Python is #23 on the list—extraordinarily low for a language that&#8217;s so widely used. Python is easy to like; I could love Python just for getting rid of curly braces. But aside from that, what’s to love? I&#8217;ve always said &#8220;don&#8217;t choose the language, choose the libraries,&#8221; and Python has great libraries, particularly for numerical work. <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\">Pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://numpy.org/\">Numpy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scipy.org/\">Scipy</a>, and <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a> are good reasons to love Python, all by themselves. Features like list comprehensions eliminate a lot of the bookkeeping associated with traditional control structures. Python is as good for tasks that are quick and dirty as it is for bigger projects. If I want to do something with a spreadsheet, I almost always hack at it with Python. (Me? Pivot tables?) And tools like Jupyter make it easy to record your experimentation while you&#8217;re in the process.<br><br>On the “big project” end of the scale, Python is easy to read: no eyeburn from nested curly braces or parens, and fewer levels of nesting thanks to comprehensions, maps, and other features.&nbsp; It has reasonable (though admittedly quirky) object-oriented features. I’ve gone back to some of my older loopy scripts, and frequently been able to write them without loops at all. If you want to put one coherent thought on a line, that’s the best of all possible worlds.<br><br>An important slogan from &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\">The Zen of Python</a>&#8221; is &#8220;Explicit is better than implicit&#8221;; you&#8217;re very rarely left guessing about what someone else meant, or trying to decipher some unexpected bit of magic that “happened.” Python wins the award for the most popular language to inspire minimal dislike. It&#8217;s got a balanced set of features that make it ideal for small projects, and good for large ones.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: And what shall we say about JavaScript, sixteenth on the list? I&#8217;ve got nothing. It’s a language that grew in a random and disordered way, and that programmers eventually learned could be powerful and productive, largely due to Doug Crockford’s classic <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/\">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>. A language that’s as widely used as JavaScript, and that’s only 16th on the list of most dreaded languages, is certainly doing something right.\\xa0 But I don’t have to like it.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s lots more that could be said.\\xa0 There’s no surprise that VBA is #1 disliked language.\\xa0 I’ll admit to complete ignorance on Objective C (#2), which I’ve never had any reason to play with. Although I’m a Perl-hater from way back, I’m surprised that Perl is so widely disliked (#3), but some wounds never heal. It will be interesting to see what happens after Perl 7 has been out for a few years. Assembly (#4) is an acquired taste (and isn’t a single language).\\xa0 If you don’t learn to love it, you pretty much have to hate it. And if you don’t love it, you really shouldn’t be using it. You can almost always avoid assembly, but when you need to work directly with the hardware, there’s no alternative.\\xa0 C and C++ (#5 and #8, respectively) give you a lot of rope to hang yourself, but get you as close enough to the hardware for almost any project, without the pain of assembly.\\xa0 Are they fading into the past, or will they be with us forever?\\xa0 My guess is the latter; there are too many projects that demand C’s performance and ubiquity. It’s the foundation for just about everything important in modern computing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Speculating about languages and why they’re liked or disliked is fun.&nbsp; It may or may not be useful.&nbsp; Take it for what it’s worth.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/C4I2o4fCV3Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

It sounds simplistic to state that AI product managers should develop and ship products that improve metrics the business cares about. Though these concepts may be simple to understand, they aren’t as easy in practice. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Agreeing on metrics</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s often difficult for businesses without a mature data or machine learning practice to define and agree on metrics. Politics, personalities, and the tradeoff between short-term and long-term outcomes can all contribute to a lack of alignment. Many companies face a problem that’s even worse: no one knows which levers contribute to the metrics that impact business outcomes, or which metrics are important to the company (such as those reported to Wall Street by publicly-traded companies). Rachel Thomas writes about these challenges in “<a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/2019/09/24/metrics/\">The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI</a>.” There isn’t a simple fix for these problems, but for new companies, investing early in understanding the company’s metrics ecosystem will pay dividends in the future.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The worst case scenario is when a business doesn’t have any metrics. In this case, the business probably got caught up in the hype about AI, but hasn’t done any of the preparation. (Fair warning: if the business lacks metrics, it probably also lacks discipline about data infrastructure, collection, governance, and much more.) Work with senior management to design and align on appropriate metrics, and make sure that executive leadership agrees and consents to using them before starting your experiments and developing your AI products in earnest. Getting this kind of agreement is much easier said than done, particularly because a company that doesn’t have metrics may never have thought seriously about what makes their business successful. It may require intense negotiation between different divisions, each of which has its own procedures and its own political interests. As Jez Humble said in a<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-2015\"> Velocity Conference</a> training session, “Metrics should be painful: metrics should be able to make you change what you’re doing.” Don’t expect agreement to come simply.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lack of clarity about metrics is technical debt worth paying down. Without clarity in metrics, it’s impossible to do meaningful experimentation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Ethics</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A product manager needs to think about ethics–and encourage the product team to think about ethics–throughout the whole product development process, but it’s particularly important when you’re defining the problem.&nbsp; Is it a problem that should be solved?&nbsp; How can the solution be abused? Those are questions that every product team needs to think about.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a substantial literature about ethics, data, and AI, so rather than repeat that discussion, we’ll leave you with a few resources.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ethics-and-data/9781492043898/\">Ethics and Data Science</a> is a short book that helps developers think through data problems, and includes a checklist that team members should revisit throughout the process. The Markkula Institute at the University of Santa Clara has an excellent list of <a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/\">resources</a>, including an <a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics-app/\">app</a> to aid ethical decision-making. The <a href=\"https://ethicalos.org/\">Ethical OS</a> also provides excellent tools for thinking through the impact of technologies.&nbsp; And finally–build a team that includes people of different backgrounds, and who will be affected by your products in different ways. It’s surprising (and saddening) how many ethical problems could have been avoided if more people thought about how the products would be used. AI is a powerful tool: use it for good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Addressing the problem</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you know which metrics are most important, and which levers affect them, <em>you need to run experiments</em> to be sure that the AI products you want to develop actually map to those business metrics. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Experiments allow AI PMs not only to test assumptions about the relevance and functionality of AI Products, but also to understand the effect (if any) of AI products on the business. AI PMs must ensure that experimentation occurs during three phases of the product lifecycle:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li><strong>Phase 1: Concept</strong><br>During the concept phase, it’s important to determine if it’s even possible for an AI product “<a href=\"https://medium.com/recombee-blog/personalized-push-notifications-enabled-by-artificial-intelligence-8ac057bc97ba\">intervention</a>” to move an upstream business metric.&nbsp; Qualitative experiments, including research surveys and sociological studies, can be very useful here.<br><br>For example, many companies use recommendation engines to boost sales. But if your product is highly specialized, customers may come to you knowing what they want, and a recommendation engine just gets in the way. Experimentation should show you how your customers use your site, and whether a recommendation engine would help the business.<br></li><li><strong>Phase 2: Pre-deployment</strong><br>In the pre-deployment phase, it’s essential to ensure that <a href=\"https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0853-dengA.pdf\">certain metrics thresholds</a> are not violated by the core functionality of the AI product. These measures are commonly referred to as <a href=\"https://medium.com/@SplitSoftware/papers-we-love-lessons-learned-from-microsoft-and-yahoo-product-experimentation-experts-a4275ebfd1a\">guardrail metrics</a>, and they ensure that the product analytics aren’t giving decision-makers the wrong signal about what’s actually important to the business.<br><br>For example, a business metric for a rideshare company might be to reduce pickup time per user; the guardrail metric might be to maximize trips per user. An AI product could easily reduce average pickup time by dropping requests from users in hard-to-reach locations. However, that action would result in negative business outcomes for the company overall, and ultimately slow adoption of the service. If this sounds fanciful, it’s not hard to find AI systems that took inappropriate actions because they optimized a poorly thought-out metric. The guardrail metric is a check to ensure that an AI doesn’t make a “mistake.”<br><br>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s Law</a>). Any metric can and will be abused.&nbsp; It is useful (and fun) for the development team to brainstorm creative ways to game the metrics, and think about the unintended side-effects this might have.&nbsp; The PM just needs to gather the team and ask “Let’s think about how to abuse the pickup time metric.”&nbsp; Someone will inevitably come up with “To minimize pickup time, we could just drop all the rides to or from distant locations.” Then you can think about what guardrail metrics (or other means) you can use to keep the system working appropriately.<br></li><li><strong>Phase 3: Post-deployment</strong><br>After deployment, the product needs to be instrumented to ensure that it continues to behave as expected, without harming other systems. Ongoing monitoring of critical metrics is yet another form of experimentation. AI performance tends to degrade over time as the environment changes. You can’t stop watching metrics just because the product has been deployed.<br><br>For example, an AI product that helps a clothing manufacturer understand which materials to buy will become stale as fashions change. If the AI product is successful, it may even cause those changes. You must detect when the model has become stale, and retrain it as necessary.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Fault Tolerant Versus Fault Intolerant AI Problems</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI product managers need to understand how sensitive their project is to error. This isn’t always simple, since it doesn’t just take into account technical risk; it also has to account for social risk and reputational damage. As we mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-you-need-to-know-about-product-management-for-ai/\">first article</a> of this series, an AI application for product recommendations can make a lot of mistakes before anyone notices (ignoring concerns about bias); this has business impact, of course, but doesn’t cause life-threatening harm. On the other hand, an autonomous vehicle really can’t afford to make any mistakes; even if the autonomous vehicle is safer than a human driver, you (and your company) will take the blame for any accidents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Planning and managing the project</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI PMs have to make tough choices when deciding where to apply limited resources. It’s the old “choose two” rule, where the parameters are Speed, Quality, and Features. For example, for a mobile phone app that uses object detection to identify pets, speed is a requirement. A product manager may sacrifice either a more diverse set of animals, or the accuracy of detection algorithms.&nbsp; These decisions have dramatic implications on project length, resources, and goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-1048x400.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13174\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-1048x400.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-300x114.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-768x293.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01.png 1235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The &#8220;choose two&#8221; rule</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Similarly, AI product managers often need to choose whether to prioritize the scale and impact of a product over the difficulty of product development.&nbsp; Years ago a health and fitness technology company realized that its content moderators, used to manually detect and remediate offensive content on its platform, were experiencing extreme fatigue and very poor mental health outcomes.&nbsp; Even beyond the humane considerations, moderator burnout was a serious product issue, in that the company’s platform was rapidly growing, thus exposing the average user to more potentially offensive or illegal content.&nbsp; The difficulty of content moderation work was exacerbated by its repetitive nature, making it a candidate for automation via AI.&nbsp; However, the difficulty of developing a robust content moderation system at the time was significant, and would have required years of development time and research. Ultimately, the company decided to simply drop the most social components of the platform, a decision which limited overall growth. This tradeoff between impact and development difficulty is particularly relevant for products based on deep learning: breakthroughs often lead to unique, defensible, and highly lucrative products, but investing in products with a high chance of failure is an obvious risk. Products based on deep learning can be difficult (or even impossible) to develop; it’s a classic “high return versus high risk” situation, in which it is inherently difficult to calculate return on investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The final major tradeoff that AI product managers must evaluate is how much time to spend during the R&amp;D and design phases.&nbsp; With no restrictrictions on release dates, PMs and engineers alike would choose to spend as much time as necessary to nail the product goals. But in the real world, products need to ship, and there’s rarely enough time to do the research necessary to ship the best possible product. Therefore, product managers must make a judgment call about when to ship, and that call is usually based on incomplete experimental results. It’s a balancing act, and admittedly, one that can be very tricky: achieving the product’s goals versus getting the product out there. As with traditional software, the best way to achieve your goals is to put something out there and iterate. This is particularly true for AI products. <a href=\"https://exp-platform.com/experiments-at-microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/making-the-linkedin-experimentation-engine-20x-faster\">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/https-medium-com-jonathan-parks-scaling-erf-23fd17c91166\">Airbnb</a> have been especially candid about their journeys towards building an experiment-driven culture and the technology required to support it. Some of the best lessons are captured in Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, and Ya Xu’s book: <a href=\"https://experimentguide.com/\">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments : A Practical Guide to A/B Testing</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The AI Product Development Process</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The development phases for an AI project map nearly 1:1 to the AI Product Pipeline we described in the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/practical-skills-for-the-ai-product-manager/\">second article</a> of this series. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-1048x731.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13175\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-1048x731.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-300x209.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-768x536.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02.png 1180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: CRISP-DM aligned with AI Pipeline</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI projects require a “feedback loop” in both the product development process and the AI products themselves. Because AI products are inherently research-based, experimentation and iterative development are necessary. Unlike traditional software development, in which the inputs and results are often deterministic, the AI development cycle is probabilistic. This requires several important modifications to how projects are set up and executed, regardless of the project management framework.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Understand the Customer and Objectives</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Product managers must ensure that AI projects gather qualitative information about customer behavior. Because it might not be intuitive, it’s important to note that traditional data measurement tools are more effective at measuring <em>magnitude</em> than <em>sentiment</em>. For most AI products, the product manager will be less interested in the click-through rate (CTR) and other quantitative metrics than they are in the utility of the AI product to the user. Therefore, traditional product research teams must engage with the AI team to ensure that the correct intuition is applied to AI product development, as AI practitioners are likely to lack the appropriate skills and experience. CTRs are easy to measure, but if you build a system designed to optimize these kinds of metrics, you might find that the system sacrifices actual usefulness and user satisfaction. In this case, no matter how well the AI product contributes to such metrics, it’s output won’t ultimately serve the goals of the company.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s easy to focus on the wrong metric if you haven’t done the proper research. One mid-sized digital media company we interviewed reported that their Marketing, Advertising, Strategy, and Product teams once wanted to build an AI-driven user traffic forecast tool. The Marketing team built the first model, but because it was from marketing, the model optimized for CTR and lead conversion. The Advertising team was more interested in cost per lead (CPL) and lifetime value (LTV), while the Strategy team was aligned to corporate metrics (revenue impact and total active users).&nbsp; As a result, many of the tool’s users were dissatisfied, even though the AI functioned perfectly. The ultimate result was the development of multiple models that optimize for different metrics, and the redesign of the tool so that it could present those outputs clearly and intuitively to different kinds of users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Internally, AI PMs must engage stakeholders to ensure alignment with the most important decision-makers and top-line business metrics. Put simply, no AI product will be successful if it never launches, and no AI product will launch unless the project is sponsored, funded, and connected to important business objectives.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data Exploration and Experimentation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This phase of an AI project is laborious and time consuming, but completing it is one of the strongest indicators of future success. A product needs to balance the investment of resources against the risks of moving forward without a full understanding of the data landscape. Acquiring data is often difficult, especially in regulated industries. Once relevant data has been obtained, understanding what is valuable and what is simply noise requires statistical and scientific rigor.&nbsp; AI product managers probably won’t do the research themselves; their role is to guide data scientists, analysts, and domain experts towards a product-centric evaluation of the data, and to inform meaningful experiment design. The goal is to have a measurable signal for what data exists, solid insights into that data’s relevance, and a clear vision of where to concentrate efforts in designing features.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data wrangling and feature engineering is the most difficult and important phase of every AI project.&nbsp; It’s generally accepted that, during a typical product development cycle, <a href=\"https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/the-value-is-in-the-data-wrangling\">80% of a data scientist’s time is spent in feature engineering</a>. Trends and tools in AutoML and Deep Learning have certainly reduced the time, skills, and effort required to build a prototype, if not an actual product.&nbsp; Nonetheless, building a superior feature pipeline or model architecture will always be worthwhile. AI product managers should make sure project plans account for the time, effort, and people needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Modeling and Evaluation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The modeling phase of an AI project is frustrating and difficult to predict. The process is inherently iterative, and some AI projects fail (for good reason) at this point. It’s easy to understand what makes this step difficult: there is rarely a sense of steady progress towards a goal. You experiment until something works; that might happen on the first day, or the hundredth day. An AI product manager must motivate the team members and stakeholders when there is no tangible “product” to show for everyone’s labor and investment.&nbsp; One strategy for maintaining motivation is to push for short-term bursts to beat a performance baseline. Another would be to start multiple threads (possibly even multiple projects), so that some will be able to demonstrate progress.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Deployment</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Unlike traditional software engineering projects, AI product managers must be heavily involved in the build process. Engineering managers are usually responsible for making sure all the components of a software product are properly compiled into binaries, and for organizing build scripts meticulously by version to ensure reproducibility. Many mature DevOps processes and tools, honed over years of successful software product releases, make these processes more manageable, but they were developed for traditional software products. The equivalent tools and processes simply do not exist in the ML/AI ecosystem; when they do, they are rarely mature enough to use at scale. As a result, AI PMs must take a high-touch, customized approach to guiding AI products through production, deployment, and release.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like any other production software system, after an AI product is live it must be monitored. However, for an AI product, both model performance <em>and</em> application performance must be monitored simultaneously. Alerts that are triggered when the AI product performs out of specification may need to be routed differently; the in-place SRE team may not be able to diagnose technical issues with the model or data pipelines without support from the AI team.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Though it’s difficult to create the “perfect” project plan for monitoring, it’s important for AI PMs to ensure that project resources (especially engineering talent) aren’t immediately released when the product has been deployed.&nbsp; Unlike a traditional software product, it’s hard to define when an AI product has been deployed successfully.&nbsp; The development process is iterative, and it’s not over after the product has been deployed–though, post-deployment, the stakes are higher, and your options for dealing with issues are more limited.&nbsp; Therefore, members of the development team must remain on the maintenance team to ensure that there is proper instrumentation for logging and monitoring the product’s health, and to ensure that there are resources available to deal with the inevitable problems that show up after deployment. (We call this “debugging” to distinguish it from the evaluation and testing that takes place during product development. The final article in this series will be devoted to debugging.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Among operations engineers, the idea of <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-and-observability-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter/\">observability</a> is gradually replacing monitoring.&nbsp; Monitoring requires you to predict the metrics you need to watch in advance.&nbsp; That ability is certainly important for AI products–we’ve talked all along about the importance of metrics.&nbsp; Observability is critically different.&nbsp; Observability is the ability to get the information you need to understand why the system behaved the way it does; it’s less about measuring known quantities, and more about the ability to diagnose “unknown unknowns.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Executing on an AI Product Roadmap</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve spent a lot of time talking about planning.&nbsp; Now let’s shift gears and discuss what’s needed to build a product.&nbsp; After all, that’s the point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>AI Product Interface Design</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI product manager must be a member of the design team from the start, ensuring that the product provides the desired outcomes. It’s important to account for the ways a product will be used. In the best AI products, users can’t tell how the underlying models impact their experience. They neither know or care that there is AI in the application. Take <a href=\"https://www.stitchfix.com/\">Stitch Fix</a>, which uses a multitude of algorithmic approaches to provide customized style recommendations. When a Stitch Fix user interacts with its AI products, they interface with the prediction and recommendation engines. The information they interact with during that experience is an AI product–but they neither know, nor care, that AI is behind everything they see. If the algorithm makes a perfect prediction, but the user can’t imagine wearing the items they’re shown, the product is still a failure. In reality, ML models are far from perfect, so it is even more imperative to nail the user experience.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To do so, product managers must ensure that design gets an equal seat at the table with engineering.&nbsp; Designers are more attuned to qualitative research about user behavior.&nbsp; What signals show user satisfaction?&nbsp; How do you build products that delight users? Apple’s sense of design, making things that “just work,” pioneered through the iPod, iPhone, and iPad products is the foundation of their business.&nbsp; That’s what you need, and you need that input from the beginning.&nbsp; Interface design isn’t an after-the-fact add-on.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Picking the Right Scope</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Creeping featurism” is a problem with any software product, but it’s a particularly dangerous problem for AI. Focus your product development effort on problems that are relevant to the business and consumer. A successful AI product measurably (and positively) impacts metrics that matter to the business. Therefore, limit the scope of an AI product to features that can create this impact. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To do so, start with a well-framed hypothesis that, upon validation through experimentation, will produce meaningful outcomes. Doing this effectively means that AI PMs must learn to translate business intuitions into product development tools and processes. For example, if the business seeks to understand more about its customer base in order to maximize lifetime value for a subscription product, an AI PM would do well to understand the tools available for customer and product-mix segmentation, recommendation engines, and time-series forecasting. Then, when it comes to developing the AI product roadmap, the AI PM can focus engineering and AI teams on the <em>right experiments</em>, <em>the correct outcomes</em>,andthe<em> smoothest path to production</em>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is tempting to over-value the performance gains achieved through the use of more complex modeling techniques, leading to the dreaded “black box” problem: models for which it’s difficult (if not impossible) to understand the relationship between the input and the output. Black box models are seldom useful in business environments for several reasons. First, being able to <a href=\"https://www.aiforpeople.org/tools-for-explainability-and-transparency/\">explain how the model works</a> is often a prerequisite for executive approval. Ethical and regulatory considerations often require a detailed understanding of the data, derived features, pipelines and scoring mechanisms involved in the AI system. Solving problems with the simplest model possible is always preferable, and not just because it leads to models that are interpretable. In addition, simpler modeling approaches are more likely to be supported by a wide variety of frameworks, data platforms, and languages, increasing interoperability and decreasing technical debt.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another scoping consideration concerns the processing engine that will power the product. Problems that are real-time (or near real-time) in nature can only be addressed by highly performant stream processing architectures. Examples of this include product recommendations in e-commerce systems or AI-enabled messaging. Stream processing requires significant engineering effort, and it’s important to account for that effort at the beginning of development. Some machine learning approaches (and many software engineering practices) are simply not appropriate for near-real time applications. If the problem at hand is more flexible and less interactive (such as offline churn probability prediction), batch processing is probably a good approach, and is typically easier to integrate with the average data stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prototypes and Data Product MVPs</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Entrepreneurial product managers are often associated with the phrase “Move Fast and Break Things.”&nbsp; AI product mangers live and die by “Experiment Fast So You <em>Don’t</em> Break Things Later.”&nbsp; Take any social media company that sells advertisements. The timing, quantity, and type of ads displayed to segments of a company’s user population are overwhelmingly determined by algorithms. Customers contract with the social media company for a certain fixed budget, expecting to achieve certain audience exposure thresholds that can be measured by relevant business metrics. The budget that is actually spent successfully is referred to as <em>fulfillment</em>, and is directly related to the revenue that each customer generates. Any change to the underlying models or data ecosystem, such as how certain demographic features are weighted, can have a dramatic impact on the social media company’s revenue. Experimenting with new models is essential–but so is yanking an underperforming model out of production. This is only one example of why rapid prototyping is important for teams building AI products. AI PMs must create an environment in which continuous experimentation and failure are allowed (even celebrated), along with supporting the processes and tools that enable experimentation and learning through failure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a previous section, we introduced the importance of user research and interface design.&nbsp; Qualitative data collection tools (such as <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/\">Qualtrics</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/forms/about/\">Google Forms</a>) should be joined with interface prototyping tools (such as <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\">Invision</a> and <a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\">Balsamiq</a>), and with data prototyping tools (such as <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/install\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>) to form an ecosystem for product development and testing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once such an environment exists, it’s important for the product manager to codify what constitutes a “minimum viable” AI product (MVP). This product should be robust enough to be used for user research and quantitative (model evaluation) experimentation, but simple enough that it can be quickly discarded or adjusted in favor of new iterations. And, while the word “minimum” is important, don’t forget “viable.” An MVP needs to be a product that can stand on its own, something that customers will want and use. If the product isn’t “viable” (i.e., if a user wouldn’t want it) you won’t be able to conduct good user research. Again, it’s important to listen to data scientists, data engineers, software developers, and design team members when deciding on the MVP.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Data Quality and Standardization</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In most organizations, Data Quality is either an engineering or IT problem; it is rarely addressed by the product team until it blocks a downstream process or project. This relationship is impossible for teams developing AI products. “Garbage in, garbage out” holds true for AI, so good AI PMs must concern themselves with data health.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many excellent resources on <a href=\"https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-quality\">data quality</a> and <a href=\"http://www.datagovernance.com/defining-data-governance/\">data governance</a>. The specifics are outside the scope of this article, but here are some core principles that should be incorporated into any product manager’s toolkit:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Beware of “data cleaning” approaches that damage your data. It’s not data cleaning if it changes the core properties of the underlying data.&nbsp;</li><li>Look for peculiarities in your data (for example, data from legacy systems that truncate text fields to save space).</li><li>Understand the risks of bad downstream standardization when planning and implementing data collection (e.g. arbitrary stemming, stop word removal.).</li><li>Ensure data stores, key pipelines, and queries are properly documented, with structured metadata and a well-understood data flow.</li><li>Consider how time impacts your data assets, as well as seasonal effects and other biases.</li><li>Understand that data bias and artifacts can be introduced by UX choices and survey design.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Augmenting AI Product Management with Technical Leadership</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There is no intuitive way to predict what will work best in AI product development. AI PMs can build amazing things, but this often comes largely from the right frameworks rather than the correct tactical actions. Many new tech capabilities have the potential to enable software engineering using ML/AI techniques more quickly and accurately. AI PMs will need to leverage new and emerging AI techniques (image upscaling, synthetic text generation using adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and more), and partner with expert technologists to put these tools to use.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s unlikely that every AI PM will have world-class technical intuition in addition to excellent product sense, UI/X experience, customer knowledge, leadership skills, and so on. But don’t let that breed pessimism. Since one person can’t be an expert at everything, AI PMs need to form a partnership with a technology leader (e.g., a <a href=\"https://ajahne.github.io/blog/leadership/2018/02/16/what-is-a-tech-lead.html#:~:text=A%20Tech%20Lead%20is%20a,to%20achieve%20a%20collective%20goal.&amp;text=A%20Tech%20Lead%20is%20learning,delegating%20work%20effectively%20without%20micromanaging.\">Technical Lead </a>or Lead Scientist) who knows the state of the art and is familiar with current research, and trust that tech leader’s educated intuition.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finding this critical technical partner can be difficult, especially in today’s competitive talent market.&nbsp; However, all is not lost:&nbsp; there are many excellent technical product leaders out there masquerading as competent engineering managers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Product manager Matt Brandwein suggests observing what potential tech leads do in their idle time, and taking note of which domains they find attractive. Someone’s current role often doesn’t reveal where their interests and talent lie. Most importantly, the AI PM should look for a tech lead who can mitigate their own weaknesses. For example, if the AI PM is a visionary, picking a technical lead with operational experience is a good idea.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Testing ML/AI Products</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When a product is ready to ship, the PM will work with user research and engineering teams to develop a release plan that collects both qualitative and quantitative user feedback. The bulk of this data will be concentrated on user interaction with the user interface and front end of the product. AI PMs must also plan to collect data about the “hidden” functionality of the AI product, the part no user ever sees directly: model performance. We’ve discussed the need for proper instrumentation at both the model and business levels to gauge the product’s effectiveness; this is where all of that planning and hard work pays off!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the model side, performance metrics that were validated during development (predictive power, model fit, precision) must be constantly re-evaluated as the model is exposed to more and more unseen data. A/B testing, which is frequently used in web-based software development, is useful for evaluating model performance in production. Most companies already have a framework for A/B testing in their release process, but some may need to invest in testing infrastructure. Such investments are well worth it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s inevitable that the model will require adjustments over time, so AI PMs must ensure that whoever is responsible for the product post-launch has access to the development team in order to investigate and resolve issues. Here, A/B testing has another benefit: the ability to run champion/challenger model evaluations. This framework allows for a deployed model to run uninterrupted, while a second model is evaluated against a sample of the total population. If the second model outperforms the original, it can simply be swapped out-often without any downtime!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Overall, AI PMs should remain closely involved in the early release lifecycle for AI products, taking responsibility for coordinating and managing A/B tests and user data collection, and resolving issues with the product’s functionality. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this article, we’ve focused primarily on the AI product development process, and mapping the AI product manager’s responsibilities to each stage of that process. As with many other digital product development cycles, AI PMs must first ensure that the problem to be solved is both a problem that ML/AI <em>can</em> solve and a problem that is vital to the business. Once this criteria has been met, the AI PM must consider whether the product <em>should</em> be developed, considering the myriad of technical and ethical considerations at play when developing and releasing a production AI system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We propose the AI Product Development Process as a blueprint for AI PMs of all industries, who may develop myriad different AI products. Though this process is by no means exhaustive, it emphasizes the kind of critical thinking and cross-departmental collaboration necessary to success at each stage of the AI product lifecycle. However, regardless of the process you use, experimentation is the key to success.&nbsp; We’ve said that repeatedly, and we aren’t tired: the more experiments you can do, the more likely you are to build a product that works (i.e., positively impacts metrics the company cares about).&nbsp; And don’t forget qualitative metrics that help you understand user behavior!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once an AI system is released and in use, however, the AI PM has a somewhat unique role in product maintenance. Unlike PMs for many other software products, AI PMs must ensure that robust testing frameworks are built and utilized not only during the development process, but also in post-production. Our next article focuses on perhaps the most important phase of the AI product lifecycle: maintenance and debugging.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/DDocWJDec48\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

       "               '<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21298762/face-depixelizer-ai-machine-learning-tool-pulse-stylegan-obama-bias\">article</a> in The Verge discussed <a href=\"https://github.com/adamian98/pulse#what-does-it-do\">PULSE</a>, an algorithm for “upsampling” digital images. PULSE, when applied to a low-resolution image of Barack Obama, recreated a White man&#8217;s face; applied to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it built a White woman&#8217;s face.\\xa0 It had similar problems with other images of Black and Hispanic people, frequently giving them White skin and facial features. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>PULSE could be used for applications like upsampling video for 8K ultra high-definition, but I’m less interested in the algorithm and its applications than in the discussion about ethics that it provoked. Is this just a problem with training data, as Yann LeCun said on Twitter?\\xa0 Or is it a sign of larger systemic issues about bias and power, as Timnit Gebru argued? The claim that this is only a problem with the data is tempting, but it is important to step back and see the bigger issues: nothing is “just” a problem with data.\\xa0 That shift to a wider perspective is badly needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s no question that the training data was a problem.\\xa0 If the algorithm were trained using a set of photos dominated by Black people, it would no doubt turn White faces into Black ones. With the right training set and training process, we could presumably minimize errors. When looked at this way, it&#8217;s largely a problem of mathematics and statistics. That’s the position that Timnit Gebru rejects, because it obscures the bigger issues hiding behind the training set. As organizations like <a href=\"http://d4bl.org/\">Data For Black Lives</a>, <a href=\"https://blackinai.github.io/\">Black in AI</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</a>, and others have been pointing out, it&#8217;s never just an issue of statistics. It&#8217;s an issue of harms and of power. Who stands to gain? Who stands to lose? That&#8217;s the point we really need to consider, particularly when we&#8217;re asking AI to create &#8220;information&#8221; where nothing existed before. Who controls the erasure, or the creation, of color? What are the assumptions that lie behind it?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I do not believe there are many AI researchers giggling about turning Black people into Whites (though there are no doubt some). Nor do I believe there&#8217;s some kind of racist demon lurking in the mathematics implemented by neural networks. But errors like this nevertheless happen; they happen all too frequently; the results are often harmful; and none of us are surprised that the transition was Black-&gt;White rather than the other way around. We were not surprised when we found that products like COMPAS recommended tougher criminal sentences for Black people than for Whites; nor were we surprised when Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini showed that <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212\">facial recognition is much less accurate</a> for Black people than White people, and particularly inaccurate for Black women.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, how do we think about the problem of power and race in AI? Timnit Gebru is right; saying that the problem is in the training data ignores the real problem.\\xa0 As does being saddened and making vague promises about doing better in the future.\\xa0 If we aren’t surprised, why?\\xa0 What do we have to learn, and how do we put that learning into practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can start by considering what &#8220;biased training data&#8221; means. One of my favorite collections of essays about data is <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/raw-data-oxymoron\">&#8220;Raw Data&#8221; is an Oxymoron</a>. There is no such thing as &#8220;raw data,&#8221; and hence, no pure, unadulterated, unbiased data. Data is always historical and, as such, is the repository of historical bias. Data doesn’t just grow, like trees; data is collected, and the process of data collection often has its own agenda. Therefore, there are different ways of understanding data, different ways of telling stories about data–some of which account for its origin and relation to history, and some of which don’t.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Take, for example, housing data. That data will show that, in most places in the US, Black people live in separate neighborhoods from White people. But there are a number of stories we can tell about that data.\\xa0 Here are two very different stories:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Segregated housing reflects how people want to live: Black people want to live near other Black people, and so on.</li><li>Segregated housing reflects many years of policy aimed at excluding Black people from White neighborhoods: lending policy, educational policy, real estate policy.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many variations on those stories, but those two are enough. Neither is entirely wrong—though the first story erases an important fact, that White people have generally had the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining\">power</a> to prevent Black people from moving into their neighborhoods. The second story doesn’t treat that data as an intransigent given; it critiques the data, asks that data how and why it came to be.\\xa0 As I’ve <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-we-learn-from-ais-biases/\">argued</a>, AI is capable of revealing our biases, and showing us where they are hidden.\\xa0 It gives us an opportunity to learn about and critique our own institutions.\\xa0 If you don’t look critically at the data, its origins, and its stories (something that’s not a part of most computer science curricula), you’re likely to institutionalize the bias embedded in the data behind a wall of <a href=\"https://www.mathwashing.com/\">mathwashing</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are plenty of situations in which that critique is needed.\\xa0 Here’s one: researchers looking at ride data from Chicago’s public data portal found that the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04599.pdf\">dynamic pricing algorithms</a> used by ride-hailing services (such as Uber and Lyft) charged more for rides to and from low-income, nonwhite areas. This effect might not have been discovered without machine learning.\\xa0 It means that it’s time to audit the services themselves, and find out exactly why their algorithms behave this way. And it’s an opportunity to learn what stories the data is telling us.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The real issue is which of those stories we choose to tell. I use the word &#8220;we&#8221; because the data doesn&#8217;t tell a story on its own, any more than a pixelated image of President Obama becomes a White man on its own. Someone chooses what story to tell; someone releases the software; and that someone is a person, not an algorithm. So if we really want to get to the bottom of the upsampling problem with PULSE, we need to be looking at people in addition to training data. If PULSE needed more images of Black people in its training set, why didn&#8217;t it have them? And why are we not surprised that these issues show up all the time, in applications ranging from <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm\">COMPAS</a> to the Google app that tagged Black people as gorillas?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s really a question about the teams of people who are creating and testing this software. They are predominantly White and male. I admit that if I wrote a program that upsampled images, it might not occur to me to test a Black person’s face. Or to test whether jail sentences for White and Black people are comparable. Or to test whether a real estate application will recommend that Black people consider buying homes in largely White neighborhoods. These not-so-microaggressions are the substance from which greater abuses of power are made. And we’re more likely to discover those microaggressions in time to stop them if the teams developing the software include people with Black and Brown faces, as well as White ones.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem isn’t limited to building teams that realize we need different training data, or that understand the need for testing against different kinds of bias.\\xa0 We also need teams that can think about what applications should and shouldn’t be built. Machine learning is complicit in many power structures. Andrew Ng&#8217;s newsletter, The Batch, gives <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/11/deepmind-researchers-propose-rebuilding-the-ai-industry-on-a-base-of-anticolonialism/\">payday lending</a> as an example. An application might compute the optimal interest rate to charge any customer, and that app might easily be &#8220;fair&#8221; by some mathematical standard–although even that is <a href=\"https://medium.com/datakinduk/no-fair-how-can-we-guarantee-fairness-in-ai-e13c92befe42\">problematic</a>. But the industry itself exists to take advantage of vulnerable, low-income people. In this situation, it is impossible for an algorithm—even a &#8220;fair&#8221; one—to be fair. Likewise, given the current power structures, along with the possibility for abuse, it is very difficult to imagine a face recognition application, no matter how accurate, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/defund-facial-recognition/613771/\">that isn’t subject to abuse</a>. Fairness isn’t a mathematical construct that can be embodied by an algorithm; it has everything to do with the systems in which the algorithm is embedded. The algorithms used to identify faces can also be used to identify <a href=\"https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/\">bird species</a>, <a href=\"https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/\">detect diseased tomatoes</a> on a farm, and the like. The ethical problem isn’t the algorithm, it’s the context and the power structures, and those are issues that most software teams aren’t used to thinking about.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s an even better example close at hand: PULSE itself.\\xa0 Obscuring faces by replacing them with low-resolution, pixelated images is a classic way of protecting the identity of the person in the photograph.\\xa0 It’s something people do to protect themselves–a particularly important issue in these days of incognito armies. Software like PULSE, even (especially) if it is trained correctly, undoes individuals’ efforts to protect their own privacy.\\xa0 It tips the power relationship even further in the direction of the empowered. And an application like Stanford’s <a href=\"http://blm.stanford.edu/\">#BlackLivesMatter PrivacyBot</a> tips the balance back the other way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many ways to address these issues of bias, fairness, and power, but they all start with building inclusive teams, and with taking a step back to look at the bigger issues involved. You are more likely to detect bias if there are people on the team who have been victims of bias. You are more likely to think about the abuse of power if the team includes people who have been abused by power. And, as I&#8217;ve argued elsewhere, the job of &#8220;programming&#8221; is becoming less about writing code, and more about understanding the nature of the problem to be solved. In the future, machines will write a lot of code for us. Our task will be deciding what that software should do—not putting our heads down and grinding out lines of code. And that task isn&#8217;t going to go well if our teams are monochromatic.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/4vYzmXiKdDA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

IBM&#8217;s announcement went the furthest; they&#8217;re <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software\">withdrawing</a> from face recognition research and product development. Amazon&#8217;s statement was much more limited; they&#8217;re putting a <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition\">one-year moratorium</a> on the police use of their Rekognition product, and hoping that Congress will pass regulation on the use of face recognition in the meantime.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These statements are fine, as far as they go. As many point out, Amazon and Microsoft are just passing the buck to Congress, which isn&#8217;t likely to do anything substantial. (As far as I know, Amazon is still partnering with local police forces on their <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Privacy-advocates-alarmed-by-Amazon-s-Ring-15059699.php\">Ring smart lock</a>, which includes a camera.) And, as others have pointed out, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon are not the most important companies that supply face recognition technology to law enforcement. That&#8217;s dominated by a number of less prominent companies, of which the most visible are Palantir and Clearview AI. I suspect the executives at those companies are smiling; perhaps IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon aren&#8217;t the most important players, but their departure (even if only temporary) means that there&#8217;s less competition.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, much as I approve companies pulling back from products that are used unethically, we also have to be clear about what this actually accomplishes: not much. Other companies that are less concerned about ethics will fill the gap.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another response is increased efforts within cities to ban the use of face recognition technologies by police. That trend, of course, isn&#8217;t new; San Francisco, Oakland, Boston, and a number of other cities have instituted such bans. Accuracy is an issue—not just for people of color, but for anyone. London&#8217;s police chief is on record as saying that he&#8217;s &#8220;completely comfortable&#8221; with the use of face recognition technology, despite their department&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535814/uk-face-recognition-police-london-accuracy-completely-comfortable\">98% false positive rate</a>. I&#8217;ve seen similar statements, and similar false positive rates, from other departments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&#8217;ve also seen the first known case of a person <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882678392/man-says-he-was-falsely-arrested-after-facial-recognition-mistake\">falsely arrested because of face recognition</a>. &#8220;First known case&#8221; is extremely important in this context; the victim only found out that he was targeted by face recognition because he overheard a conversation between police officers. We need to ask: how many people have already been arrested, imprisoned, and even convicted on the basis of incorrect face recognition? I am sure that number isn&#8217;t zero, and I suspect it is shockingly large.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>City-wide bans on the use of face recognition by police are a step in the right direction; statewide and national legislation would be better; but I think we have to ask the harder question. Given that police response to the protests over George Floyd&#8217;s murder has revealed that, in many cities, law enforcement is essentially lawless, will these regulations have any effect? Or will they just be ignored? My guess is &#8220;ignored.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That brings me to my point: given that companies backing off from sales of face recognition products, and local regulation of the use of these products, are praiseworthy but unlikely to be effective, what other response is possible? How do we shift the balance of power between surveillors and surveillees? What can be done to subvert these systems?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are two kinds of responses. First, the use of extreme fashion. <a href=\"https://cvdazzle.com/\">CVDazzle</a> is one site that shows how fashion can be used to defeat face detection. There are others, such as <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/juggalo-makeup-facial-recognition/\">Juggalo makeup</a>. If you don&#8217;t like these rather extreme looks, remember that researchers have shown that even a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945\">few altered pixels</a> can defeat image recognition, changing a stop sign into something else. Can a simple &#8220;birthmark,&#8221; applied with a felt-tip pen or lipstick, defeat face recognition? I have not read anything about this specifically, but I would bet that it can. Facemasks themselves provide good protection from face ID, and COVID-19 is not going away any time soon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem with these techniques (particularly my birthmark suggestion) is that you don&#8217;t know what technology is being used for face recognition, and useful adversarial techniques depend highly on the specific face recognition model. The CVDazzle site states clearly that it&#8217;s designs have only been tested against one algorithm (and one that is now relatively old.) Juggalo makeup doesn’t alter basic facial structure. Fake birthmarks would depend on very specific vulnerabilities in the face recognition algorithms. Even with facemasks, there has been research on reconstructing images of faces when you only have an image of the <a href=\"https://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/13756-from-ears-to-faces.html\">ears</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many vendors (including Adobe and YouTube) have provided tools for <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/29/video-editing-tools-photo-apps-blur-faces-protect-identity/5284733002/\">blurring faces</a> in photos and videos.\\xa0Stanford has just released\\xa0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://blm.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">a new web app</a>\\xa0that detects all the faces in the picture and blocks them out. Anyone who is at a demonstration and wants to take photographs should use these.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we shouldn&#8217;t limit ourselves to defense. In many cities, police refused to identify themselves; in Washington DC, an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/05/protests-washington-dc-federal-agents-law-enforcement-302551\">army of federal agents</a> appeared, wearing no identification or insignia. And similar incognito armies have recently appeared in Portland, Oregon and other cities. Face recognition works both ways, and I bet that most of the software you&#8217;d need to construct a face recognition platform is open source. Would it be possible to create a tool for identifying violent police officers and bringing them to justice? Indeed, human rights groups are already using AI: there’s an important initiative to use AI to document <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/25/1004466/ai-could-help-human-rights-activists-prove-war-crimes/\">war crimes in Yemen</a>. If it’s difficult or impossible to limit the use of facial recognition by those in power, the answer may well be to give these tools to the public to increase accountability–much as David Brin suggested many years ago in his prescient book about privacy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society\"><em>The Transparent Society.</em></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology &#8220;solutionism&#8221; won&#8217;t solve the problem of abuse—whether that&#8217;s abuse of technology itself, or more plain old physical abuse. But we shouldn&#8217;t naively think that regulation will put technology back into some mythical &#8220;box.&#8221; Face recognition isn&#8217;t going away. That being the case, people interested in justice need to understand it, experiment with ways to deflect it, and perhaps even to start using it.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Iei1x99gJpY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

What are they using them for? Are they having success? If so, what kinds of benefits are they seeing? What can we learn from their failures?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So we did what we usually do: we ran a survey. The survey ran from January 31, 2020 through February 29; we had 1502 respondents from the readers of our mailing lists. Here’s a summary of our key findings:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Most adopters are successful with microservices.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A minority (under 10%) reports “complete success,” but a clear majority (54%) describes their use as at least “mostly successful” and 92% of the respondents had at least some success.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Microservices practices are surprisingly mature</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> About 28% of respondents say their organizations have been using microservices for at least three years; more than three-fifths (61%) of the respondents have been using microservices for a year or more.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Adopters are betting big on microservices</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Almost one-third (29%) of respondents say their employers are migrating or implementing a majority of their systems (over 50%) using microservices.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Success with microservices means owning the software lifecycle</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Most (74%) respondents say their teams own the build-test-deploy-maintain phases of the software lifecycle. Teams that own the lifecycle succeed at a rate 18% higher than those that don’t.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Success with containers</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Respondents who used containers to deploy microservices were significantly more likely to report success than those who didn’t.

Decomposing monolithic applications into microservices is also a major challenge, but complexity may be the biggest challenge of all.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Respondent Demographics</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Technical roles dominate, but management roles are represented, too.&nbsp;</em>Software engineers comprise the survey audience’s single largest cluster, over one quarter (27%) of respondents (Figure 1). If you combine the different architectural roles—i.e., software and systems architects, technical leads—architects represent almost 28% of the sample. Adding architects and engineers, we see that roughly 55% of the respondents are directly involved in software development. Respondents in management roles constitute close to 23% of the audience; executive-level positions (vice presidents and CxOs) account for roughly 13%, overall.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the audience for this survey—like those of almost all Radar surveys—is disproportionately technical. Technical roles represented in the “Other” category include IT managers, data engineers, DevOps practitioners, data scientists, systems engineers, and systems administrators. Each of these roles comprised less than 3% of all respondents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-1048x699.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13104\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-1048x699.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1.png 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Respondent roles</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Respondents work in more than 25 different vertical industries</em>.The single largest cluster consists of respondents (26%) from the software industry. Combined, technology verticals—software, computers/hardware, and telecommunications—account for about 35% of the audience (Figure 2).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_02-1-1048x825.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13103\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_02-1-1048x825.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_02-1-300x236.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_02-1-768x605.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_02-1.png 1054w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 2: Respondent industries</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The second-largest cluster (exclusive of “Other”) was finance, at close to 12%, followed by consulting/professional services, at roughly 10%. The “Other” category, at more than 22% of the total, includes respondents from education (3%, combining K12 and higher education), insurance (3%), energy and utilities (2%), media/entertainment (2%), non-profit (2%), consumer products (1%) and other verticals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Microservices aren’t just for the big guys</em>. Large companies are amply represented, and respondents affiliated with organizations of 1,000 or more employees comprise 42% of the audience. Overall, however, small- and medium-sized organizations predominate. The largest single cluster (33% of all respondents) was organizations with under 100 employees.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>A good global mix</em>. We’re used to seeing a North American-centric tilt in our Radar surveys. This is true, too, of the audience for this survey, nearly half of which (over 49%) works in North America. Europe—inclusive of the United Kingdom—was the next largest region, comprising almost 26% of all respondents. Asia-Pacific accounts for roughly 15% of respondents. In total, just over half of the audience hails from outside of North America. This roughly mirrors usage on the O’Reilly learning platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Microservices Adoption: Explication and Analysis</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Slightly more than one-third of respondents say their organizations have been using microservices for between 1 and 3 years (Figure 3). This is the single largest cluster in our sample. The second-largest cluster, at nearly one-quarter (over 23%) of respondent organizations, does not use microservices at all. Mature adopters, companies that first adopted microservices between 3 and 5 years ago, comprise the third-largest cluster, at 18%. If you factor in the respondents whose organizations first adopted microservices over 5 years ago, this means that more than 28% of respondent organizations have been using microservices for at least three years. A little under one-sixth of companies (15%) are just beginning microservice adoption, however; they’ve been using microservices for less than 1 year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13105\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1.png 994w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1-768x433.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 3: Duration of use of microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The pace of adoption, in which a clear majority (61%) of respondents say their organizations have used microservices for between 1 and 5 years, roughly tracks with empirical trends we’ve observed internally (e.g., with respect to keyword search and topic usage activity on the O’Reilly online learning platform) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F011spz0k\">in other contexts</a>. The share of adoption for the 12-month period between January of 2019 and January of 2020 likewise suggests that microservices remains a topic of interest to O’Reilly users. On the other hand, there’s evidence from other quarters that interest in microservices—<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2019-01-31%202020-01-31&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F011spz0k\">both as a topic</a>&nbsp;and as a general&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2019-01-31%202020-01-31&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Microservices\">search term</a>—has flattened (and perhaps even cooled) over the 12 months.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So not only are most respondents using microservices, but three-fifths (61%) have been using them for a year or more. But do they describe their experience as successful? What share of the systems they’re deploying or maintaining are built to microservices architecture? What characteristics do successful adopters share? What can we learn from those who say they’ve failed with microservices?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Critical Factors for Success</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A majority of respondents (55%) say their organization’s use of microservices has been either a “complete success” (close to 9%) or “mostly successful” (Figure 4).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13106\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1.png 973w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1-300x189.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1-768x483.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 4: Success with microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than one-third (37%) say they’ve had “some success” with microservices. Approximately 8% say they haven’t been successful at all. However, relationships in the data hint at several critical factors for success. For example, in organizations in which development teams own the entire development cycle (i.e., building, testing, deployment, and maintenance), close to half (almost 49%) also reported being “mostly successful” with microservices—and more than 10% said their microservices development efforts were a “complete success. (Figure 5). The combined tally (close to 59%) is about 18% higher than the baseline tally for the survey audience as a whole.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13107\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1.png 837w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1-768x417.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 5: Do dev teams own/not own the software lifecycle?</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Do we see meaningful connections between success with microservices and the use, or disuse, of specific technologies? Perhaps; we’ll take a look at that next, specifically with respect to containers, centrally managed databases, and monolithic UIs. The semantics get a bit twisted, but the connections we identify seem more strongly associated with “disuse” than with “use.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We emphasize the qualifier “seem” because—with respect to the problem of identifying factors for success—we lack detailed data to draw rigorous conclusions. We kept our survey simple; our priority was to develop a general sense of how, why, and in which scenarios people are using microservices. For the most part, our questions didn’t drill down into specifics. We emphasize “seem” for another reason, too. When we asked respondents to cite the biggest challenges to microservices adoption, two problems—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)\">decomposition</a>&nbsp;and complexity—stood out for us. Decomposition because it came in at #2, trailing only corporate culture / mindset, which (in almost all Radar surveys) is #1; complexity because two ostensibly different kinds of complexity—“increased complexity” (#4) and the “complexity of managing many services” (#5)—cracked the top 5. Add them together and respondents view complexity in one form or another as the biggest challenge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upshot is that complexity in general and (more specifically) the complexity associated with decomposition are the shoals in which most microservices projects seem to run aground. That’s hard to argue with; complexity is rarely (if ever) associated with success. But it’s easy to pretend that complexity is the enemy when it’s really only one variable in a set of tradeoffs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What does that mean? Although it’s not a question we asked, anecdotally we hear that most microservices projects are replacing large, legacy, monolithic software systems. Those monoliths are themselves very complex, having evolved over decades. The complexity of the monolith that’s being replaced is a “sunk cost” that has only partially been paid; it continues to extract a toll as that software is extended to support new features, changing business models, changing modes of user interaction, and more. Microservices may require paying a complexity cost again, but that’s where the tradeoff comes in: in return for the complexity of re-engineering the system, you get increased flexibility, including a simpler path to adding new features, simpler management, simplified scaling as the organization grows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Use of Containers for Microservice Deployment</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked respondents what proportion of their microservices they deploy using containers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The largest single cluster (38%) for this question consists of respondents that do not deploy their microservices in containers. One might reasonably expect that containers would be the most common means of instantiating microservices. This just isn’t the case, however. Our findings indicate that, for our survey audience as a whole, most respondents (58%) deploy microservices using some medium other than containers (Figure 6).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13108\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1.png 903w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1-300x176.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1-768x451.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 6: Proportion of microservices deployed using containers</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are valid reasons not to use containers. For some adopters, technical debt (in the form of custom-built, proprietary and monolithic systems, applications, or architectures) is a constraining factor. So it just makes sense to instantiate microservices at the level of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization\">virtual machine</a>&nbsp;(VM), as distinct to that of the container. Or maybe it’s faster and less costly, at least in the short term, to build and instantiate microservices as non-virtualized code running in the context of a conventional operating system, a database, application server, etc..</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This doesn’t mean respondents aren’t using containers; most of the survey audience is. It’s just that containers are not yet the most popular means of instantiating microservices, although that could be changing. For example, the second-largest cluster (31%) for this question consists of organizations that deploy between 75% and 100% of their microservices using containers. And 11% use containers to deploy between 50 and 75% of their microservices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upshot is that more than two-fifths (42%) of respondent organizations use containers to deploy at least half of their microservices—and that, for the survey audience as a whole, nearly two-thirds (62%) are using containers to deploy at least&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of their microservices. So we have a split: on the one hand, most microservices are instantiated using a technique other than containers; on the other hand, most organizations that use microservices also instantiate at least some of them in containersFor example, 10% of respondents say they use containers to deploy between 10-25% of their microservices; a little more than 9% deploy between 25-50% of microservices with containers; and, again, 11% deploy between 50-75% using containers.<sup>1</sup> It seems adopters either go (mostly) all-in on containers, using them for most microservices, or use them sparingly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a critical, and intriguing, “but” here: a higher than average proportion of respondents who report success with microservices opt to instantiate them using containers; conversely, a much higher proportion of respondents who describe their microservices efforts as “Not successful at all”&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;instantiate them in containers. For example, almost half (49%) of respondents who describe their deployments as “a complete success” also instantiate most of their microservices (75-100%) in containers. This is more than 5x the baseline (9%) for this question. Conversely, an overwhelming majority (83%) of respondents who describe their microservices efforts as “Not successful at all” are instantiating them by some means other than containers. (These are respondents who use containers in conjunction with less than 10% of their microservices.) This is about 11x the baseline for this question (Figure 4).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This observation makes intuitive sense. With microservices, instead of deploying one monolithic application, you may need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of services. Using containers to standardize deployment, and container orchestration tools to automate ongoing management, greatly simplifies the burden of deployment and management. It’s worth remembering that “containers” get their name by analogy to shipping containers: instead of loading a ship with 10,000 cases of canned soup, 20,000 board-feet of lumber, and a few thousand automobile tires, the shippers would pack their goods in standardized containers that could be stacked up on the ship. This represents a significant reduction in the cost of shipping–or the operational cost of deploying and maintaining software. Containers are a simplifying technology.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Use of a Central, Managed Database</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we asked respondents what proportion of their microservices share a central, managed database (Figure 7), we found that not using a centrally managed database with microservices tends to be associated with failure. That said, the question itself (i.e., “What percentage of your microservices share a centrally-managed database?”) doesn’t give us much to go on. We don’t know what respondents considered a centrally managed database; what kind of database they were using (relational or non-relational); or whether transactional integrity was an issue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13109\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1.png 901w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1-768x462.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 7: Proportion of microservices that use a centrally managed database</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Granted that there’s a lot we’d like to know that we don’t, let’s think about why this question is important, and dig a bit deeper. The point of microservices is breaking an application into separate, decoupled services. Using the database as the integration point between services is counter to this purpose. The result is a software system that looks like it’s built from microservices, but really isn’t, and which realizes few of the promised advantages because the individual services are still coupled to each other at the database layer.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Are our respondents succeeding with decoupled databases? For our survey audience, it looks like the smaller the proportion of microservices that share access to a central, managed database, the greater the likelihood of failure. Think of this as what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\">survivorship bias</a>&nbsp;is most apt to miss: i.e., failure. The lesson in such cases is usually that failure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d\">tells a valuable story of its own</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the respondents who said that they are “not successful at all,” 71% said that they did not make much use of a centrally managed database (under 10% of their microservices). The problem is that we don’t actually know what using (or not using) a centrally managed database entails because the question itself is imprecise. For example, a recommended practice is to implement a separate namespace for each microservice. This can be accomplished in several ways—including by using a centralized database!<sup>2</sup> But implementing a separate namespace for each service raises a number of hard problems, starting with transactional integrity and data consistency, and (notionally) encompassing security and privacy, too. Working through these issues isn’t easy, even with a centralized database. It’s much harder without one, however.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, while it’s easy to look at these failures and suppose that using a separate database (or database schema) per service is a bad idea that leads to failure, that’s far from the whole picture. Think back to where we started this section: microservices represents a tradeoff of complexity against flexibility. (And also a tradeoff of complexity now versus complexity accreted over the years in a legacy system–we could perhaps think of paying off technical debt with a big “balloon payment.”) Replacing a legacy monolith with microservices isn’t easy. But working through the current complexity to build a system that’s more likely to serve your future needs is what good engineering is all about. And when you’re building a complex system, you need to know where the pain points are. That’s what this data is really telling us: redesigning databases to eliminate dependencies between services is a significant pain point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Monolithic UI</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also asked users what percentage of the systems deployed as microservices had a monolithic user interface (Figure 8). This question is also problematic. First, what is a monolithic UI? More to the point, what would our respondents assume we mean by a monolithic UI, and what are they doing if they’re not building a monolithic UI? There are several possibilities, none of which is entirely convincing. One recent trend in web development is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html\">“micro frontends”</a>, but this doesn’t appear to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=micro%20frontend,microservice\">well-known enough</a>&nbsp;to have a significant effect on our data. Respondents are likely to associate a “monolithic UI” with traditional web development (or perhaps even desktop applications or ancient “green screens”), as opposed to the use of components within a framework like React. (Since micro frontends are built with frameworks like React, these may be two names for almost the same thing. Once you’re using a component-based framework, associating components with individual back-end services isn’t a big leap.) In any case, it is likely that a monolithic UI represents a tradeoff for simplicity over flexibility and complexity. A front end built with a modern reactive web framework is almost certainly more flexible–and more complex–than a 1990s-era web form.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Use of a monolithic UI is another possible example of survivorship bias; it’s also another case in which respondents who are successful with microservices are much less interesting than those who aren’t.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13110\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1.png 904w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1-300x177.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1-768x454.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 8: Proportion of microservices that use a monolithic UI</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Take the cluster of respondents who&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;build a monolithic UI. (That is, &lt;10% of their microservices use a monolithic UI.) At 31% of all respondents, this is the largest group. But it also has the highest rate of complete failure: 17% describe their implementations as “Not successful at all.” Respondents in this group were also more likely to describe their projects as a “complete success” (12%); 37% said they were “mostly successful.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At the other end of this spectrum, among respondents who used a monolithic UI for 50-75% of their systems, only 2% said they were not successful at all. 8% said their projects were a “complete success,” while 52% said their projects were “mostly successful.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are we to make of this? It’s hard to say, given that the notion of a monolithic UI (and its opposite) are poorly defined. But this looks similar to what we observed for databases. Reactive web frameworks (like React and Angular), which are used to build many modern web interfaces, are very complex systems in their own right. It’s not surprising that systems that don’t use a monolithic UI have a high failure rate, and that systems that implement a monolithic UI have a fairly high success rate; if simplicity for developers were the only criteria, we’d all go back to green screens.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than just looking at a “complexity tax,” we have to consider what the goal is: building systems that can easily be extended and scaled as conditions change. Is a UI that isn’t monolithic (regardless of the technology) more complex? Probably so. Ideally, moving a monolithic application’s back end to microservices while maintaining the legacy front-end would be minimal work (though “minimal” is always more minimal in theory than in practice). What’s gained in return? Additional flexibility; in this case, we’d be looking for the ability to support different kinds of user interfaces and different kind of interactions. Adding a mobile or voice UI to a legacy front end can easily become a nightmare; but it’s hard to imagine any modern application that doesn’t have a mobile front-end, and in a few years, it will be hard to imagine an application without a voice-driven front end. Re-envisioning the front end in terms of services (however they may be implemented) is building flexibility into the system. What other user interfaces will we need in the next few years? Again, the issue is never simply “complexity”; it’s what you get in return.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Benefits and Challenges</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Respondents were asked which benefits, if any, they attribute to their successful use of microservices (Figure 9). They were asked to select all applicable benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The largest cluster for this response (at 45%) named “feature flexibility,” followed (at just under 45%) by “responding quickly to changing technology and business requirements.” Just under 44% cited the benefit of “better overall scalability,” followed (43%) by “more frequent code refreshes.” The least-cited benefit (15%) was that of lower development costs; just 20% of respondents say they realized one of the core promises of microservices: improved availability by virtue of multiple, redundant functions (i.e., services).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-1048x730.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13111\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-1048x730.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-300x209.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-768x535.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1.png 1223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 9: Benefits of using microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Almost all of our Radar surveys have found that respondents cite corporate culture as one of the top two or three impediments to adoption or success. This survey was no exception. Culture was the most oft-cited challenge: almost 40% of respondents cited culture—or, alternatively, the problem of “overcoming existing mindset”—as among the biggest challenges they faced in adopting microservices (Figure 10). This was the largest cluster for this response, followed (37%) by the challenge of decomposing requirements into primitive/granular functions. The challenge of integrating with legacy systems was third, cited by approximately 30% of respondents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we combine the two responses that have to do with complexity (“Increased complexity” and “Complexity of managing many services”), we find that complexity in one form or another is the biggest overall challenge, cited by 56% of respondents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-768x1048.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13112\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-768x1048.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-220x300.png 220w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-1126x1536.png 1126w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1.png 1253w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 10: Challenges encountered in adoption of microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other results of note: at No. 6, technical debt (cited by 28% of respondents) just missed the top five. It’s the kind of hard problem that cannot be wished, willed, or architected away–indeed, replacing a monolithic system with microservices can be seen as a “lump sum” payment of years of accrued technical debt. The rest of the top 10 reads like a laundry list of hard problems: API quality (28%), talent and skill shortages (28%), training and retraining challenges (also 28%) and monitoring/observability (27%) round out the top 10. The high showing for API quality—i.e., their richness, robustness, transparency, accessibility, stability (over time) and usefulness—shouldn’t be surprising. The relatively low result for security (No. 11, cited by 21% of respondents) is surprising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Takeaways</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For the most part, adopters say they’re having success with microservices: more than half (55%) describe their efforts as at least “mostly” successful. Respondents commonly attribute several clear benefits to their use of microservices, including feature flexibility; the ability to respond to changing business requirements; improved scalability; and more frequent code releases. And, at least among adopters, microservices comprise a growing share of production systems: almost half (46%) of respondents say their organizations are currently developing for or migrating one-quarter or more of their production systems to microservices. Nearly one-sixth (15%) say they’re developing or migrating between 75-100% of their systems to a microservices-oriented architecture. For our audience, microservices architecture is not only established but (for a majority of adopters) used to support systems or workloads in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s evidence here for the microservices skeptic, too. About 8% of would-be adopters describe their experiences with microservices as “not successful at all.” Proponents will claim that 8% is a shockingly low rate of failure for any software development project, particularly given the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-68-percent-of-it-projects-fail/\">historical failure rates of large IT projects</a>; but skeptics will counter that 8% is still, well, 8%. And even if a majority of respondents say they’ve been “mostly successful” with microservices, a sizable percentage (37%) say they’ve had only “some” success. The upshot is that a little under half (45%) of all users have had bad, middling, or only modestly successful experiences with microservices. A skeptic might also point to selection bias: not only is our audience dominated by people in technical roles, but software developers and architects are overrepresented. A survey like this is bound to attract a disproportionate share of participants with an interest in seeing microservices succeed—or fail. In the same way, the person who volunteers her time to complete our survey is more likely than not to be working with or to have an interest in (for or against) microservices. These are all valid objections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our results emphasize the importance of&nbsp;<em>pragmatic</em>&nbsp;microservices development. Microservices can be complex–there’s no point in denying that. And complexity frequently leads to failure–there’s no point in denying that, either. Using containers for deployment is a way of minimizing complexity. We’ve seen that decoupling databases is frequently a pain point, along with redesigning the user interface as a set of components. But again, it’s important to recognize that microservices rarely arise out of nowhere. Many microservice projects are replacing existing systems. And that existing system has its own complexity: complexity that grew over the years, complexity that’s preventing you from achieving your current goals. If you&#8217;ve become accustomed to your legacy systems, you probably don&#8217;t realize how complex they are–but if you’ve made the decision to migrate from a monolith to microservices, the complexity of maintaining your monolith is almost certainly the reason.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Replacing one kind of complexity with another–is that a gain? Absolutely, if it’s done correctly and enables you to achieve your goals. Complexity is an engineering problem, and engineering problems are always about tradeoffs. When you’re building microservices, keep your eye on the goal–whether that’s supporting new features, scaling for more customers, providing a new experience for users, or something else. Don&#8217;t be surprised that microservices bring their own complexity, and don&#8217;t let that daunt you. But don&#8217;t underestimate the challenge, either.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Special thanks to Kristen Haring, Phil Harvey, Mark Madsen, Roger Magoulas, Larry “Catfish” Murdock, Sam Newman, and Mac Slocum for—among other invaluable contributions—questions, comments, context, and, above all, constructive criticism.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>1</sup> For example, 10% of respondents say they use containers to deploy between 10-25% of their microservices; a little more than 9% deploy between 25-50% of microservices with containers; and, again, 11% deploy between 50-75% using containers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>2</sup> A development team could use a centrally managed database to create separate namespaces for each service.

Or, alternatively, software developers could opt to manage data persistence (along with data consistency and transactional durability) on a per-microservices basis, a practice that is strictly consistent with the idea of data sovereignty, but which radically ups the complexity factor.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/DDKyM3r0Vy4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

       "               '<h2>A World of Individuals</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our world is on fire. For too long we have been complicit, maintaining the status quo. This must change. I’m writing this as we’re living through three pandemics. Covid-19, structurally enabled racism, and the climate crisis. Each of these pandemics make visible the ways that individuals fit into and contribute to wider communities. Or fail to fit in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before Covid-19, it’s likely that <em>society</em> made you think of liberal politics or charity or posh events that you rarely get invited to. Now, I bet you think of society as community. We’ve all become more aware of how connected we are to one another, and our responsibilities to our communities. That’s not only for us as people, but for business too. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Until now innovation frameworks like human-centered design, jobs to be done or design thinking have focused on two things. The first is serving the individual in order to make products and services that people want. This is often called “user needs.” The second is following a “growth imperative,” and a financial measure of success. We’ve asked how software and hardware could help drive profit and GDP.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The result is products and services that give us superpowers. You have a pocket supercomputer that can conveniently beckon a taxi instantly to you. You know exactly where you are. You can instantly communicate and transact from anywhere. However these superpowers come at a cost: your attention is a scarce commodity and your data is put to use in an ocean of advertising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What strikes me the most is that these innovation frameworks only work when organizations and their teams operate from a place of privilege. It’s easier to ignore the unintended consequences (the “negative externalities” in the industry’s dry jargon) when you are personally not impacted. So it’s unsurprising that institutions like Harvard or Stanford gave birth to these methodologies, Silicon Valley companies popularized them, and consultancies packaged them into toolkits. These are organizations that are often predominantly white, male, and affluent.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here’s an example. A new generation of electric bike and scooter rideshare startups made it possible to pick up or leave a scooter anywhere in a city. They removed the charging docks, so the user no longer had to find one that had a scooter available to be used, or had a spare slot to return the scooter to. The user would just tell the app that they’d finished with it, and the app took care of the rest, which was very convenient. But this made the experience of moving around the city harder for everyone else, and particularly affected those with limited mobility. So much focus went into serving the needs of the individual that the needs of other people went ignored.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It doesn’t stop at products and services. Individualism has shaped much of our social contract in the West. Data protection frameworks like Europe’s GDPR give us <em>individual</em> rights to data that represents us. Consent is asked for on an individual basis, with cookie banners being the ultimate divide-and-conquer attack on humanity. If consent was gained through hurried and weary clicks on nagging pop-up barriers on countless websites, can it be considered freely given?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A problem with design for the individual is the assumption that data necessarily represents one person. But it doesn’t. In nearly all cases, data represents many people. For example your DNA represents your parents, siblings, and children. Your location data represents where you’ve been with other people, where you see your friends or the walk to school with your kids. Data is inherently social and represents society.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Society-Centered Design</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://societycentered.design/\">Society-centered design</a> comes in. At IF, a technology studio that I run, we believe it’s time to do better. It’s time to make <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/anti-racist-by-design-for-sharing-economy-platforms/\">better design approaches</a> and <a href=\"https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com/\">tools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/how-to-measure-representation-in-a-data-set-and-protect-peoples-privacy/\">better measures of success</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/using-data-for-public-good/\">better data protection standards</a>. We need a new framework for products, services, and data that is purpose-built for the 21st century. We want to move beyond human-centered design to society-centered design. Where society, not an individual, is at the center.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Society-centered design is about changing the climate of ideas, and moving towards real-world solutions. It’s an approach to problem solving, that develops solutions by putting society in every step of the problem-solving process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How could we make rideshare scooters work for wider society as well as the riders? This question is timely because the UK Government is accelerating a plan to allow rentable electric scooters in towns and cities to provide socially-distanced alternatives to public transport.&nbsp; Perhaps the scooters could be dockable so the streets could be less cluttered: the scooter companies would work with local authorities to provide many more docks. The docks could be sufficiently standardized that <em>any</em> scooter or bike could use them for secure storage and charging. Working with open standards, working with the city, working with people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A different and speculative example is how we might rethink data management. <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/a-bold-new-future-for-permissions/\">I’ve written before</a> about how hard it is to stay on top of all the consent choices you’ve made. If your data preferences change, are you going to visit a million websites to modify the communication and cookie preferences you clicked half a decade ago? What if instead you were able to delegate decision making to an entity that represents your values? That way the consent management is dealt with by a third party. This isn’t a new idea. Tom Steinberg has written about organizations, “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@TomSteinberg/personal-data-representatives-an-idea-d2274d1af69b\">personal data representatives</a>,” that could take on this role. I explored the idea of data cooperatives in 2014. Now there are a growing number of ‘data trust’ experiments from the Open Data Institute, Uber drivers, Sidewalk Labs, and others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Designing for society means designing for the broader context of systems that we impact and shape. To do this, we must be intentional about citizen empowerment, civic commons, public health, equity, and the planet:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Citizen empowerment: how might we give people more rights and capabilities?</li><li>Civic commons: how might we create shared resources that strengthen communities?</li><li>Public health: how might we protect the safety and improve the physical and mental health of communities?</li><li>Equity: how might we design products, services, and standards that are fair to everyone, not just the most privileged?</li><li>The planet: how might we better care for our world?</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have a collective opportunity right now to design out the structural inequalities around us. To collectively hold each other accountable, to examine our existing products and services to make sure they are equitable. It’s not enough to play lip service about change within your business. It’s not enough to just look at recruitment practices. It’s not enough to make tweaks to the images you show. To take a society-centered approach means fundamentally looking at the underlying values of your business.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Until now, individual needs have been the foundation of a business’ growth, profit, and culture. Now it’s time to look towards society’s needs. </p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/usb3BbTp1_I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",

       "               '<p>At Microsoft&#8217;s Build conference, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott talked about an experimental project in which an AI, trained on code in GitHub, actually creates programs: it generates function bodies based on a descriptive comment and a message signature. (Skip to 29:00 of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNhYTLWQFeg\">the video</a>.)&nbsp; Along similar lines, an unrelated research paper reports on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03511\">unsupervised translation</a> of programs from one language to another–indeed, probably an easier task than natural language translation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Microsoft’s demo is, well, a demo, and the research paper is a research paper. Microsoft’s AI was able to provide method bodies for some relatively simple functions; it was obviously rather limited. It begs the question of exactly how you write the comment that tells the AI what to do; are we just replacing a description in a precise programming language with a description in an ambiguous, imprecise human language? I&#8217;m sure that training the model costs more than hiring a developer to write a few short functions. And while it’s easy for me to believe that software can translate some simple code from COBOL to Rust, I can only imagine that it would be horribly confused by the multitude of tricks programmers used in the 1960s and 1970s to deal with computers that had, by modern standards, miniscule memories. Programming jobs are not going to disappear tomorrow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important for us to think about what automation might mean for the future of programming.&nbsp; Is this a glimpse of the future, and if so, what is it telling us? What can we learn from it? Programming will increasingly be automated; and, as someone who got started writing assembler on a PDP-8, I can tell you that programming is already highly automated, and that a good optimizing compiler is already an advanced AI system that takes your hints and turns them into working code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Programming is not going to &#8220;go away&#8221; or &#8220;become obsolete.&#8221; However, its meaning will change. I&#8217;ve previously written about blue- and white-collar programmers: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/rethinking-programming/\">programmers who connect things, and programmers who design the things that are connected</a>, and build the tools to connect them. These are different (though highly overlapping) skillsets. And while Microsoft&#8217;s demo may show that programmers may eventually be liberated from the task of coding up simple functions, the code-generating engine was certainly built by a team of programmers, and possibly a large one. The programmers who write the higher-level tools, like Microsoft’s coding engine itself, can breathe a sigh of relief.&nbsp; As can programmers who design APIs, since you still have to provide the function/method signatures.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And the blue-collar programmers who connect things? While this demo could spit out functions, I saw few signs that it could build larger systems out of the functions that it wrote. Although it had the ability to call functions that it had written, it could not put together a large program from a written specification. It might be able to spit out a simple bill, but it certainly couldn&#8217;t spit out a complete billing system. A project for future research? No doubt, but that&#8217;s probably dozens of years out. Programmers who connect things—the plumbers of the digital world—are also safe.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But this feat still begs the question about what we mean by programming. In the video, Kevin Scott talks about reducing the time programmers spend on dull, repetitive tasks. Yes, that&#8217;s what we all say about AI: it will reduce the time spent on dull, repetitive tasks and free more time for creative work. Let&#8217;s break that down, though. Most of programming is specifying, in excruciating detail, how to execute some process. That can be dull, it is often repetitive, and it is certainly error-prone. And we really need to think more about what programming <em>ought</em> to be. To use Scott&#8217;s word, what are the &#8220;creative&#8221; aspects of programming?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that &#8220;creative&#8221; is the right word. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, more programmers were called &#8220;analysts.&#8221;&nbsp; That job title is still in use, but it’s not all that common: <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a> shows about 10,000 jobs for “programmer analyst,” 44,000 for “programmer,” and 100,000 for “software engineer.” <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/\">Monster</a> shows about 20,000 for “programmer analyst,” 300,000 for “programmer,” and 170,000 for “software engineer.” </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the job may have differed little from what it is now, let&#8217;s think about what &#8220;analyst&#8221; means. Analysts analyze a problem; they think about what the problem is, and how to solve it effectively. They think about breaking it up into parts. They may even think about whether it should be solved; they might think about how it should be solved, what ethical issues it raises and how those issues should be handled. Can the software be abused? If so, how? What steps can be taken to prevent abuse? And analysts need to think about how people will use the software: what&#8217;s the user interface, what&#8217;s the user experience, can it be used by people with disabilities?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In O’Reilly’s <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/software-architecture-superstream-series-software-architecture-fundamentals/0636920444961/\">Software Architecture Fundamentals Superstream,</a> Thoughtworks’ Rebecca Parsons said that “analysts” were essentially doing software architecture: making big picture decisions about what the software should do, and how it should be built. Analysts and architects need to understand the business case. They need to present decisions about software systems to management in business terms.&nbsp; She used the need to test a backup strategy as an example: rather than telling the CEO about the technical details, just say “This test will show us how long it will take to get back online if the system crashes on the busiest retail day of the year.” That’s what an analyst does. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our emphasis on writing code, and on measuring productivity by “lines of code,” is myopic. Just look at all the wonderful (and absolutely necessary) tools we have for building, testing, archiving, and deploying code.&nbsp; But those tools, essential and revolutionary as they are, don’t address the real issue: are we solving the right problems? There are thousands of applications out there that pass every unit test, every integration test, and every acceptance test, but are still awful to use.&nbsp; And we are learning that there are new dimensions to software that we’ve rarely thought about: are there groups who need to use our software and can’t? Does your software support accessibility?&nbsp; Can it be used by people who don’t have reliable access to computers and to networks?&nbsp; The work of an organization like <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/\">Code for America</a> isn’t technically profound or deep.&nbsp; What’s radical about a product like <a href=\"https://www.getcalfresh.org/\">GetCalFresh</a> was the act of re-engineering the system to make it usable by the people who need to use it. And we need a lot more analysis like that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to programming than just slinging code and writing functions. The most important parts of the job have nothing to do with writing quicksort on the whiteboard in an interview. There&#8217;s a lot to think about; and currently, programmers spend too much time rushing code out the door to meet a release date than they spend thinking about the bigger picture. That&#8217;s almost always someone else&#8217;s job. But whether or not it gets into production, Microsoft&#8217;s research gives us an opportunity to think about what programming really means. What&#8217;s the real job? What are we really trying to accomplish?<br></p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/773ZBvCjOn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'),\n",
