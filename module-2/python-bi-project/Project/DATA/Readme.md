# Choosing a business

## The process

I tried to narrow the search first to achieve a good category.
To do so, first I looked at the market, how many companies of each category.
Then, see how profitable they were.
Next, check how successful they were and if they deadpooled by category.

After deciding on a category, ecommerce, we looked at the competition.
Where they were located. And made a choice.

I choose Texas because it was close to the border and had several other ecommerce offices there, which mean they had good access to delivery services and other things necesary to flourish as an ecommerce.
